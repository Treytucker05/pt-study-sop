# Task Plan: Fix Scholar Smoke/Tests
<!-- 
  WHAT: This is your roadmap for the entire task. Think of it as your "working memory on disk."
  WHY: After 50+ tool calls, your original goals can get forgotten. This file keeps them fresh.
  WHEN: Create this FIRST, before starting any work. Update after each phase completes.
-->

## Goal
<!-- 
  WHAT: One clear sentence describing what you're trying to achieve.
  WHY: This is your north star. Re-reading this keeps you focused on the end state.
  EXAMPLE: "Create a Python CLI todo app with add, list, and delete functionality."
-->
Golden Path smoke test passes and dev workflow is clean: scholar digest/proposals endpoints are fast and DB-first, obsidian patch test passes, scholar outputs are ignored, tests run, commit pushed.

## Current Phase
<!-- 
  WHAT: Which phase you're currently working on (e.g., "Phase 1", "Phase 3").
  WHY: Quick reference for where you are in the task. Update this as you progress.
-->
Phase 1

## Phases
<!-- 
  WHAT: Break your task into 3-7 logical phases. Each phase should be completable.
  WHY: Breaking work into phases prevents overwhelm and makes progress visible.
  WHEN: Update status after completing each phase: pending → in_progress → complete
-->

### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery
<!-- 
  WHAT: Understand what needs to be done and gather initial information.
  WHY: Starting without understanding leads to wasted effort. This phase prevents that.
-->
- [x] Understand user intent
- [x] Identify constraints and requirements
- [x] Document findings in findings.md
- **Status:** complete
<!-- 
  STATUS VALUES:
  - pending: Not started yet
  - in_progress: Currently working on this
  - complete: Finished this phase
-->

### Phase 2: Planning & Structure
<!-- 
  WHAT: Decide how you'll approach the problem and what structure you'll use.
  WHY: Good planning prevents rework. Document decisions so you remember why you chose them.
-->
- [x] Define technical approach
- [x] Document decisions with rationale
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 3: Implementation
<!-- 
  WHAT: Actually build/create/write the solution.
  WHY: This is where the work happens. Break into smaller sub-tasks if needed.
-->
- [x] Execute the plan step by step
- [x] Keep changes minimal/backward-compatible
- [x] Test incrementally
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 4: Testing & Verification
<!-- 
  WHAT: Verify everything works and meets requirements.
  WHY: Catching issues early saves time. Document test results in progress.md.
-->
- [x] Verify all requirements met
- [x] Run targeted pytest for obsidian patch, then full pytest
- [x] Run smoke script and capture output
- [x] Document test results in progress.md
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 5: Delivery
<!-- 
  WHAT: Final review and handoff to user.
  WHY: Ensures nothing is forgotten and deliverables are complete.
-->
- [x] Review all output files
- [x] Commit + push with required message
- [ ] Provide status/log outputs
- **Status:** in_progress

## Key Questions
<!-- 
  WHAT: Important questions you need to answer during the task.
  WHY: These guide your research and decision-making. Answer them as you go.
  EXAMPLE: 
    1. Should tasks persist between sessions? (Yes - need file storage)
    2. What format for storing tasks? (JSON file)
-->
1. What is the canonical Scholar proposals endpoint path?
2. Where does Scholar digest data live in DB and how to fetch latest quickly?
3. What logic in obsidian patch generation causes duplicate content to still write a patch?

## Decisions Made
<!-- 
  WHAT: Technical and design decisions you've made, with the reasoning behind them.
  WHY: You'll forget why you made choices. This table helps you remember and justify decisions.
  WHEN: Update whenever you make a significant choice (technology, approach, structure).
  EXAMPLE:
    | Use JSON for storage | Simple, human-readable, built-in Python support |
-->
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
|          |           |

## Errors Encountered
<!-- 
  WHAT: Every error you encounter, what attempt number it was, and how you resolved it.
  WHY: Logging errors prevents repeating the same mistakes. This is critical for learning.
  WHEN: Add immediately when an error occurs, even if you fix it quickly.
  EXAMPLE:
    | FileNotFoundError | 1 | Check if file exists, create empty list if not |
    | JSONDecodeError | 2 | Handle empty file case explicitly |
-->
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
| session-catchup.py missing at C:\Users\treyt\.codex\skills\planning-with-files\scripts | 1 | Locate templates directly under repo skill assets and proceed with manual plan setup |

## Notes
<!-- 
  REMINDERS:
  - Update phase status as you progress: pending → in_progress → complete
  - Re-read this plan before major decisions (attention manipulation)
  - Log ALL errors - they help avoid repetition
  - Never repeat a failed action - mutate your approach instead
