# System 4: Intro to Agents (Integration)

## Role in the 5-Part System
- System 1: Command discipline and planning gate.
- System 2: Evals and regression safeguards.
- System 3: Knowledge base and Obsidian linkage.
- System 4: Agent design doctrine and build checklist.

## Where It Lives
- `projects/treys-agent/context/SOPs/`
- `projects/treys-agent/context/input/`

## Key Docs
- `SOPs/system_4_intro_agents.md`
- `input/system_4_source_notes.md`
- `input/system_4_checklist.md`

## How It Meshes
- Uses System 1 planning gate for all agent builds.
- Requires System 2 evals for agent changes.
- Uses System 3 knowledge base for durable agent docs.
