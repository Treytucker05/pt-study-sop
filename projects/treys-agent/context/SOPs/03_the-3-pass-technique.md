# The 3-Pass Technique

## Overview
The 3-Pass Technique is a method for reading complex material (like Anatomy textbooks) without getting stuck.

## The Three Passes
1.  **Pass 1: The Survey (5-10 mins)**
    * Scan the headings, bold terms, and images.
    * Do NOT read the paragraphs.
    * **Goal:** Build a "Scaffold" in your mind. Know *where* the info lives.

2.  **Pass 2: The Questioning (The Deep Dive)**
    * Go back to the start. Turn every heading into a question (e.g., "The Humerus" -> "What is the Humerus connected to?").
    * Read the text *only* to answer your question.
    * **Goal:** Active reading. You are hunting for answers, not passively absorbing.

3.  **Pass 3: The Synthesis (The Seed)**
    * Close the book.
    * Write down the key concepts in your own words (Seed Locking).
    * **Goal:** Retention. If you can't write it simply, you didn't learn it.
