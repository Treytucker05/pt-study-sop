# LangGraph.js (beginner)

## Install
```bash
npm install @langchain/langgraph @langchain/core
```

Optional (recommended by LangGraph docs):
```bash
npm install langchain
```

## Rookie steps
1) Install LangGraph and (optionally) LangChain.\n2) Install your LLM provider package separately.\n3) Define a small tool and build a workflow or agent graph.\n4) Run it with your chosen runtime or app setup.

## When to choose
- You want JavaScript/TypeScript agents with prebuilt LangGraph patterns.
