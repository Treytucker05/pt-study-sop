# OpenAI Agents SDK (beginner)

## What it is
- A code-first SDK for agent apps with tools, handoffs, streaming, and traces.

## Rookie steps
1) Choose Python or TypeScript.
2) Open the official Agents SDK docs and pick the quickstart.
3) Start with one agent and one tool.
4) Add traces before adding handoffs.
5) Add evals with a small test set before scaling.

## When to choose
- You want a code-first workflow instead of the visual builder.
- You need tools, streaming, or handoffs in code.
