## 2026-02-17 - Skills Curation Buckets + Export Preservation

- Applied first-pass curation buckets to:
  - `C:\Users\treyt\Desktop\Trey's Vault\Study Sessions\Agent Skills Library\04_skill_registry.yaml`
  - Counts: `active=29`, `trial=29`, `defer=57`, `retire=5`
- Hardened exporter to preserve curation on reruns:
  - `scripts/export_skills_library.py`
  - Preserves `adoption_status`, `priority`, `notes`, and custom per-skill metadata fields from existing registry rows.
  - Prevents reset to `inbox` when `python scripts/export_skills_library.py` is rerun.
- Verification:
  - `python scripts/export_skills_library.py`
  - `python -m py_compile scripts/export_skills_library.py`
