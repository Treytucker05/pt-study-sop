# Specification for Track: Finish PT Study OS (Active)

## Objective
Complete the remaining gaps needed for daily-use readiness across configuration, UI polish, and WRAP ingestion.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Validate and finalize configuration prerequisites.
- Deliver dashboard polish tasks (filters, import-to-calendar, deduplication, clustering exposure).
- Implement the WRAP ingestion pipeline and related API/UI surface.

### Out of Scope
- Changes to unrelated production infrastructure and non-track architecture work.
- New platform-level features not listed in `plan.md`.

## Deliverables
- Configuration setup completed and validated.
- `brain/` and `dashboard_rebuild/` files updated from the active plan.
- Frontend and backend behavior aligned to planned date/semester filtering, syllabus dedup behavior, WRAP handling, and Tutor issue exposure.

## Success Criteria
- User-visible polish tasks in `plan.md` can be executed and validated.
- Track plan is kept updated as work progresses.
- `plan.md` task status remains the source of truth for implementation progress.
