# Project Tracks

This file tracks all major tracks for the project. Each track has its own detailed plan in its respective folder.

Update policy: after every significant change, update this file (and the active track plan file) with current status before closing the work session.

Latest non-track update: 2026-02-20 markdown-wide terminology guard across tracked `*.md` + stale build-path cleanup in active docs (see `conductor/tracks/GENERAL/log.md`).
