Goal (incl. success criteria):
- Produce a four-section architecture + code audit report for `C:/Users/treyt/OneDrive/Desktop/pt-study-sop` covering tech stack, file map, techniques/SOP content, and organization assessment; success = clear Markdown report for planning a refactor.
Constraints/Assumptions:
- Follow repo AGENTS.md (read/update CONTINUITY.md each turn, minimize changes, prefer ASCII, no destructive actions).
- Report should be evidence-based from repo files/structure; label uncertainty as UNCONFIRMED.
Key decisions:
- None yet.
State:
  - Done:
    - Read repo `AGENTS.md` and current `CONTINUITY.md`.
  - Now:
    - Scan repo structure, dependency files, and SOP/technique docs.
  - Next:
    - Draft the requested four-section Markdown report.
Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
- None.
Working set (files/ids/commands):
- `AGENTS.md`
- `CONTINUITY.md`
