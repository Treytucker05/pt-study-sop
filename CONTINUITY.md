Goal (incl. success criteria):
- Produce a comprehensive deep-research prompt with exhaustive questions about system setup, concepts, flow, subsystems, gaps, and research directions.
Constraints/Assumptions:
- Prompt should cover SOP, Brain, Tutor, Scholar, RAG, Dashboard, Integrations, and data contracts.
- Include questions for setup, architecture, governance, and experimentation.
Key decisions:
- Prompt will be delivered as a standalone block the user can paste into a deep research tool.
State:
  - Done:
    - Confirmed the dashboard spec updates are complete.
  - Now:
    - Draft the deep-research prompt with exhaustive questions.
  - Next:
    - Deliver prompt and ask if they want it saved to a doc.
Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
- Should the prompt reference specific files/paths from the repo?
Working set (files/ids/commands):
- `CONTINUITY.md`
