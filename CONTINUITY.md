Goal (incl. success criteria):
- Define how Ralph should focus on Scholar so it uses all available AI summaries, questions, and recommendations effectively.
- Update Ralph scaffolding/prompts or PRD to reflect Scholar-focused requirements once clarified.

Constraints/Assumptions:
- Follow pt-study-sop AGENTS.md; update this Continuity Ledger each turn and on state changes.
- Use ralph + ask-questions-if-underspecified workflows; do not implement until requirements are clarified.
- Keep changes minimal and scoped; ask before destructive actions.

Key decisions:
- None yet; awaiting user clarifications.

State:
  - Done:
    - Created scripts/ralph/prd.json and Ralph scaffold files (ralph.sh, prompt.md, progress.txt).
  - Now:
    - Gather requirements for Scholar-focused behavior and define "done".
  - Next:
    - Propose a concrete PRD update or prompt changes for Ralph based on answers.

Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
- Where should the Scholar focus be implemented (prompt/prd/code)?
- What does "most effective way" mean in measurable terms?
- Which data sources must be included (specific files/dirs)?

Working set (files/ids/commands):
- C:\Users\treyt\OneDrive\Desktop\pt-study-sop\scripts\ralph\prompt.md
- C:\Users\treyt\OneDrive\Desktop\pt-study-sop\scripts\ralph\prd.json
- C:\Users\treyt\OneDrive\Desktop\pt-study-sop\scripts\ralph\progress.txt
- C:\Users\treyt\OneDrive\Desktop\pt-study-sop\CONTINUITY.md
