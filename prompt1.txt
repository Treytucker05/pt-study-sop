You are analyzing C:/pt-study-sop/scripts/swarm_workflow.ps1 to locate the status pane refresh block. Your goals: 1) Identify which lines write inline status output in each refresh cycle. 2) Note where status pane content is assembled or updated. 3) Recommend the minimal edit points (line numbers) to replace the inline output with a call to an external script every refresh, specifying where the script call should sit. Return: a Markdown list with entries like '- [lines] action -> recommendation'.
