**Task List**
1. Review react-query mutations/optimistic updates in `dashboard_rebuild/client/src/components/PlannerKanban.tsx` (done).
2. Review UI/UX issues in PlannerKanban and dashboard integration (done).

**🔴 Critical**
None.

**🟡 Suggestions**
- `dashboard_rebuild/client/src/components/PlannerKanban.tsx:227` Optimistic rollback restores the entire `planner-queue` snapshot; if multiple task updates are in flight, a single failure can revert other optimistic changes. Consider patch-based rollback (store previous item only) or a functional `setQueryData` that reverts just the affected task.
- `dashboard_rebuild/client/src/components/PlannerKanban.tsx:349` No `onDragCancel` handler; canceling a drag (Esc or drop outside) can leave `activeTaskId` set and the overlay stuck. Add `onDragCancel={() => setActiveTaskId(null)}`.
- `dashboard_rebuild/client/src/components/PlannerKanban.tsx:330` Header count uses `tasks.length`, but the UI only shows `pending`/`in_progress`. If other statuses exist, the count won’t match what’s visible. Filter count to visible statuses or show additional columns/status chips.
- `dashboard_rebuild/client/src/components/PlannerKanban.tsx:186` Actions stay enabled while a mutation is pending, so users can spam moves/completes and race the API. Consider disabling per-task buttons/drag while that task is updating or showing a per-task pending state.
- `dashboard_rebuild/client/src/components/PlannerKanban.tsx:134` Drag handle is a non-focusable `div`, so keyboard users can’t pick up tasks. Use a `button` or add `role="button"`, `tabIndex={0}`, and keyboard handlers for accessibility.
- `dashboard_rebuild/client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx:411` “Today’s Focus” compares `scheduled_date` to `new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10)` (UTC string). If `scheduled_date` includes time or users are in non-UTC timezones, tasks can be miscategorized. Compute a local “today” date and compare via parsed dates.

**🟢 Nits**
- `dashboard_rebuild/client/src/components/PlannerKanban.tsx:361` `sortTasks(pending)` and `sortTasks(inProgress)` are called twice per column; sort once into a local variable to avoid redundant work and improve readability.
- `dashboard_rebuild/client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx:416` The same `plannerQueue.filter(...)` is repeated multiple times; compute `todayTasks` once to simplify rendering and avoid extra passes.

Open questions/assumptions: None.

Test gaps: Not assessed; consider coverage around optimistic rollback with concurrent mutations and drag-cancel behavior.
