# PART 1: ENCODING STRATEGIES
*How to get information INTO memory*

---

## 1.1 DUAL CODING

**What it is:**
Combining verbal (words) and visual (images/diagrams) representations of the same information.

**Why it works:**
- Creates two separate memory traces instead of one
- If one trace fails, the other can still retrieve the information
- Visual and verbal systems reinforce each other
- Effect size: ~0.5 SD gain vs text alone (Schoenherr 2024)

**How to apply it:**
- Pair text explanations with diagrams
- Sketch while reading/listening
- Annotate images with function labels
- In anatomy: draw structures while learning names
- SOP reference: M3 Encode toolkit — "Dual-code & draw"

**Pitfalls:**
- Adding visuals that don't match the content (extraneous load)
- Passive looking vs active drawing
- Skipping the verbal explanation and only looking at pictures

**Research pointers:**
- Paivio's dual coding theory
- Mayer's multimedia learning principles
- Schoenherr et al. 2024 — visualizations meta-analysis

---

## 1.2 ELABORATIVE INTERROGATION

**What it is:**
Asking "why" and "how" questions about material, then generating your own explanations.

**Why it works:**
- Forces deeper processing than surface reading
- Connects new information to existing knowledge
- Self-generated explanations are remembered better than received ones
- Effect size: g≈0.55 (Bisra 2018)

**How to apply it:**
- After each chunk: "Why does this work this way?"
- After each diagram: "How does this lead to that?"
- SOP reference: M3 self-explain prompts, Seed-Lock mechanism
- The entire Seed-Lock system IS elaborative interrogation

**Pitfalls:**
- Asking "why" but not actually generating an answer
- Accepting "I don't know" without pushing further
- Passive "okay" instead of actual explanation (why Gated Platter rejects "okay")

**Research pointers:**
- Pressley et al. 1988 — elaborative interrogation for confusing facts
- McDaniel & Donnelly 1996 — learning with analogy
- Levels of processing (Craik & Lockhart)

---

## 1.3 GENERATION EFFECT

**What it is:**
Information you generate yourself is remembered far better than information you passively receive.

**Why it works:**
- Active production engages deeper processing
- Creates stronger retrieval pathways
- You "own" what you create
- Struggle during generation strengthens the memory trace

**How to apply it:**
- Supply your own hooks/metaphors (Seed-Lock)
- Edit AI suggestions rather than accepting them (Gated Platter)
- Predict before being told
- Fill in blanks rather than reading complete text
- SOP reference: Personal Encoding Step (PES), KWIK resonance check

**Pitfalls:**
- Accepting AI's hook without modification
- Saying "okay" or "sure" instead of generating
- Letting the tutor do the cognitive work

**Research pointers:**
- Slamecka & Graf 1978 — generation effect
- Testing effect literature (generation during retrieval)
- Productive failure / productive struggle research

---

## 1.4 KWIK ENCODING FLOW

**What it is:**
A specific sequence for encoding new terms: Sound → Function → Image → Resonance → Lock

**Why it works:**
- Sound-first captures phonetic hook before meaning interferes
- Function-first ensures you know what it DOES before memorizing what it IS
- Image tied to function creates meaningful visual
- Resonance check confirms personal ownership
- Lock prevents moving on without encoding

**How to apply it:**
1. "What does this word sound like?" (phonetic seed)
2. "What does it do/what's its job?" (function)
3. "Build an image tied to that function" (visual)
4. "Does this feel right to you?" (resonance)
5. Card/log it before moving on (lock)

**Pitfalls:**
- Jumping to image before confirming function
- Image not tied to function (random association)
- Skipping resonance check
- Moving on without locking

**Research pointers:**
- Jim Kwik's memory techniques
- Keyword method research
- Imagery and memory literature

---

## 1.5 NMMF ENCODING

**What it is:**
A 4-part structure for learning terminology: Name → Meaning → Memory Hook → Function

**Why it works:**
- Systematic approach ensures no step is skipped
- Meaning (etymology/sound-alike) creates first anchor
- Hook provides retrieval cue
- Function connects to actual use

**How to apply it:**
```
Name: Astrocyte
Meaning: Astro- = star (star-shaped cells)
Memory Hook: "Mom cells" — feed, protect, clean
Function: Support neurons by providing nutrients, maintaining BBB, regulating ions
```

**Pitfalls:**
- Skipping the meaning/etymology step
- Hook not connected to function
- Not reusing hook consistently (Hook Integration Rule)

**Research pointers:**
- Keyword method
- Elaborative interrogation
- Meaningful learning (Ausubel)

---

# PART 2: RETRIEVAL STRATEGIES
*How to get information OUT of memory*

---

## 2.1 TESTING EFFECT

**What it is:**
Retrieving information from memory strengthens that memory more than re-studying does.

**Why it works:**
- Retrieval IS the learning event, not just assessment
- Each successful retrieval strengthens the pathway
- Failed retrieval followed by feedback also strengthens memory (hypercorrection)
- Effect size: g≈0.5-0.7 (Adesope 2017)

**How to apply it:**
- Test yourself before you feel ready
- Sprint mode: test-first, teach only on miss
- Brain dumps and teach-backs before review
- SOP reference: Active Recall Gate — no topic "covered" without retrieval

**Pitfalls:**
- Waiting until you "know it" to test (defeats the purpose)
- Re-reading instead of testing
- Recognition (multiple choice) instead of recall (free response)

**Research pointers:**
- Roediger & Karpicke 2006 — test-enhanced learning
- Adesope et al. 2017 — practice testing meta-analysis
- Hypercorrection effect (Metcalfe)

---

## 2.2 SPACED RETRIEVAL

**What it is:**
Distributing retrieval practice across time with expanding intervals.

**Why it works:**
- Forgetting and re-retrieving strengthens memory more than massed practice
- Each retrieval at the edge of forgetting maximizes benefit
- Effect size: d≈0.6 in health professions (spacing RCTs)

**How to apply it:**
- Default schedule: 1-3-7-21 days
- Adjust based on performance:
  - Red (struggled) → sooner
  - Yellow (effortful success) → keep schedule
  - Green (easy) → extend interval
- SOP reference: M6 Wrap spaced schedule, retrospective timetable

**Pitfalls:**
- Cramming instead of spacing
- Not tracking when you last reviewed
- Spacing without retrieval (just re-reading at intervals)

**Research pointers:**
- Cepeda et al. 2006 — spacing effect
- Ebbinghaus forgetting curve
- Pimsleur spacing schedules

---

## 2.3 SUCCESSIVE RELEARNING

**What it is:**
Repeated retrieval practice to criterion across multiple spaced sessions.

**Why it works:**
- Combines spacing + retrieval + mastery criterion
- 2-3 correct recalls before "mastered" ensures durability
- Boosts exam performance by ~1 letter grade vs restudy (Rawson 2013)

**How to apply it:**
- Require 2-3 correct retrievals across different sessions
- Don't mark as "learned" after one success
- Track R/Y/G status across sessions
- SOP reference: Successive relearning in M4 Build, retrospective timetable

**Pitfalls:**
- One correct recall = "I know it" (overconfidence)
- Not tracking across sessions
- Massing all retrievals in one session

**Research pointers:**
- Rawson et al. 2013 — successive relearning
- Mastery learning literature
- Spacing + testing interaction studies

---

## 2.4 FREE RECALL VS CUED RECALL

**What it is:**
Free recall = retrieve everything without prompts. Cued recall = retrieve with a hint/prompt.

**Why it works:**
- Free recall is harder but builds stronger traces
- Cued recall is useful for structured knowledge
- Both are better than recognition (MCQ)

**How to apply it:**
- Brain Dump = free recall (tell me everything about X)
- Teach-Back = cued recall (walk me through the steps of X)
- Use hooks as cues when stuck
- Progress: free recall → cued → recognition as difficulty decreases
- SOP reference: Brain Dump protocol, hook-based cuing

**Pitfalls:**
- Always using cued recall (easier but less effective)
- Relying on recognition (MCQ) as primary test
- Giving up on free recall too quickly

**Research pointers:**
- Recall vs recognition literature
- Generation effect
- Retrieval difficulty and learning

---

# PART 3: ORGANIZATION STRATEGIES
*How to structure knowledge*

---

## 3.1 CHUNKING / BUCKETING

**What it is:**
Grouping related items into meaningful clusters to reduce cognitive load.

**Why it works:**
- Working memory holds ~4 chunks, not ~4 items
- Meaningful groups are easier to retrieve than random lists
- Structure provides retrieval cues

**How to apply it:**
- M2 Prime: Group items into 2-4 buckets before encoding
- Options: spatial, mechanism, compare/contrast, workflow, timeline
- "Don't memorize yet—just bucket"
- SOP reference: M2 Prime bucketing protocol

**Pitfalls:**
- Too many buckets (defeats the purpose)
- Buckets that aren't meaningful
- Trying to memorize before organizing

**Research pointers:**
- Miller's magic number 7±2 (revised to ~4)
- Chunking and expertise
- Schema theory

---

## 3.2 HIERARCHICAL FRAMEWORKS (H-SERIES)

**What it is:**
Organizing information from big picture to details: System → Subsystem → Component → Element

**Why it works:**
- Creates a mental scaffold before details
- Big picture provides retrieval structure
- Prevents getting lost in details

**How to apply it:**
- H1 System (default): System → Subsystem → Component → Element
- H2 Anatomy (opt-in): Structure → Function → Behavior → Outcome
- Use in M2 Prime for initial mapping
- SOP reference: H-series frameworks

**Pitfalls:**
- Jumping to details before establishing hierarchy
- Using wrong hierarchy for the content type
- Making hierarchy too deep (overwhelm)

**Research pointers:**
- Advance organizers (Ausubel)
- Schema theory
- Hierarchical learning structures

---

## 3.3 MECHANISM FRAMEWORKS (M-SERIES)

**What it is:**
Organizing information by cause-effect logic: Trigger → Mechanism → Result → Implication

**Why it works:**
- Captures the "why" and "how"
- Creates logical connections between concepts
- Supports clinical reasoning

**How to apply it:**
- M2 Trigger (default): Trigger → Mechanism → Result → Implication
- M6 Homeostasis: Perturbation → Correction → Baseline
- M8 Diagnosis: Cause → Mechanism → Sign → Test → Confirmation
- Use in M3 Encode for building understanding
- SOP reference: M-series frameworks

**Pitfalls:**
- Memorizing mechanism as isolated fact (missing the logic)
- Wrong framework for content type
- Skipping implication/clinical connection

**Research pointers:**
- Causal reasoning in learning
- Clinical reasoning literature
- Mechanistic understanding vs factual knowledge

---

## 3.4 INTERLEAVING VS BLOCKING

**What it is:**
Interleaving = mixing different topics/types during practice. Blocking = practicing one type until mastery, then next.

**Why it works:**
- Interleaving forces discrimination between similar concepts
- Blocking feels easier but produces less durable learning
- Effect size: g≈0.4 overall, larger for similar items (Brunmair 2019)

**How to apply it:**
- After basics are learned, mix similar-but-different items
- Create confusables list during planning
- 3+2 rotation: interleave across classes
- Within class: interleave confusable categories
- SOP reference: M4 Build interleaving, 3+2 rotation

**Pitfalls:**
- Interleaving too early (before basic understanding)
- Interleaving completely unrelated items (no benefit)
- Blocking feels productive but isn't

**Research pointers:**
- Brunmair & Richter 2019 — interleaving meta-analysis
- Rohrer & Taylor — interleaved practice
- Discrimination learning

---

# PART 4: METACOGNITION
*Thinking about your thinking*

---

## 4.1 CALIBRATION

**What it is:**
How well your confidence matches your actual performance.

**Why it works:**
- Poor calibration → bad study decisions → wasted time
- Overconfidence = studying wrong things
- Underconfidence = unnecessary anxiety
- Good calibration = efficient studying

**How to apply it:**
- Predict score before testing, compare to actual
- Track calibration gap in session logs
- JOL (Judgment of Learning) checks
- SOP reference: M6 Wrap calibration check, metrics logging

**Pitfalls:**
- Familiarity mistaken for knowledge (recognition ≠ recall)
- Not testing calibration (just assuming you know)
- Ignoring calibration data

**Research pointers:**
- Nelson & Narens — metamemory framework
- Dunning-Kruger effect
- JOL calibration research

---

## 4.2 COGNITIVE LOAD MONITORING

**What it is:**
Tracking how much mental effort you're expending and what type.

**Why it works:**
- Intrinsic load = complexity of material (can't reduce much)
- Extraneous load = bad instruction/materials (reduce this)
- Germane load = effort toward learning (maximize this)
- When total load exceeds capacity, learning fails

**How to apply it:**
- Recognize overload signals: blanking, confusion cascade, errors increasing
- Reduce chunk size when overloaded
- Track load type in session logs
- SOP reference: Weekly review load check, stuck detection

**Pitfalls:**
- Pushing through overload (doesn't work)
- Blaming yourself instead of adjusting
- Not recognizing extraneous load (bad materials)

**Research pointers:**
- Sweller — Cognitive Load Theory
- Intrinsic/extraneous/germane load distinction
- Working memory limitations

---

## 4.3 STUCK DETECTION

**What it is:**
Recognizing when you're not making progress and diagnosing why.

**Why it works:**
- Stuck ≠ stupid; it's information about what's wrong
- Different causes need different fixes
- Undetected stuck = wasted time

**How to apply it:**
Stuck signals:
- Repetition (asking same question multiple ways)
- Blank recall (nothing comes out)
- Confusion cascade (explanation makes it worse)
- Error escalation (more mistakes over time)
- Disengagement (short answers, "I guess")

Fix escalation:
1. Drop explanation level
2. Swap framework
3. Micro-step breakdown
4. Hook-first teaching
5. Concrete-to-abstract
6. Partial teach-back

SOP reference: Troubleshooting guide in 03_SUPPLEMENTAL

**Pitfalls:**
- Pushing through without diagnosing
- Using wrong fix for the problem
- Confusing fatigue with confusion

**Research pointers:**
- Impasse-driven learning
- Productive failure
- Self-regulated learning

---

## 4.4 DESIRABLE DIFFICULTIES

**What it is:**
Learning conditions that feel harder but produce better long-term retention.

**Why it works:**
- Easy learning = weak encoding
- Struggle strengthens memory traces
- Performance during learning ≠ actual learning

**The four main desirable difficulties:**
1. Spacing (vs massing)
2. Interleaving (vs blocking)
3. Retrieval practice (vs re-reading)
4. Generation (vs passive reception)

**How to apply it:**
- Embrace struggle as signal of learning
- Don't judge learning by how easy it feels
- Trust the process even when it feels slow
- SOP reference: Throughout — spacing, retrieval, generation are core

**Pitfalls:**
- Avoiding difficulty (feels bad, must not be working)
- Too much difficulty (overwhelm, different from desirable)
- Judging sessions by fluency instead of retrieval

**Research pointers:**
- Bjork & Bjork 2011 — desirable difficulties
- Performance vs learning distinction
- Fluency illusions

---

# PART 5: MEMORY TECHNIQUES
*Specific tactics for remembering*

---

## 5.1 PHONETIC HOOKS

**What it is:**
Using what a word sounds like to create a memorable association.

**Why it works:**
- Sound is processed early, before meaning
- Creates an anchor before content interferes
- Phonetic similarity aids retrieval

**How to apply it:**
- "What does this word sound like?"
- Build image from the sound, then tie to function
- Example: "Supraspinatus" → "Super spine" → image of super-strong spine initiating abduction
- SOP reference: KWIK Sound step, Phonetic Override

**Pitfalls:**
- Sound association not tied to function (random)
- Skipping straight to meaning without sound anchor
- Not capturing the phonetic hook

**Research pointers:**
- Keyword method
- Phonological loop in working memory
- Sound symbolism

---

## 5.2 VISUAL-SPATIAL ENCODING

**What it is:**
Using mental images and spatial relationships to encode information.

**Why it works:**
- Visual memory is powerful and distinct from verbal
- Spatial relationships provide retrieval structure
- "Where" helps retrieve "what"

**How to apply it:**
- Anatomy: landmarks before lists
- Draw while learning
- Use clock positions/fractions for placement
- Mental walk-through of spatial relationships
- SOP reference: Anatomy Engine visual-first protocol

**Pitfalls:**
- Passive viewing vs active visualization
- Images not connected to meaning
- Skipping spatial step for abstract content

**Research pointers:**
- Method of loci
- Dual coding theory
- Spatial cognition and memory

---

## 5.3 CONTRASTIVE HOOKS

**What it is:**
Creating distinct hooks that highlight differences between similar items.

**Why it works:**
- Similar items interfere with each other
- Explicit contrast reduces confusion
- "A is X, B is Y" provides discrimination cue

**How to apply it:**
- Put confusable items side by side
- Identify THE key distinguishing feature
- Create contrastive hook: "A is [X], B is [Y]"
- Quiz on discrimination, not just individual items
- SOP reference: Confusables list in M0 Planning

**Pitfalls:**
- Learning items separately without contrast
- Hooks that are too similar for confusable items
- Not testing discrimination

**Research pointers:**
- Interference theory
- Discrimination learning
- Interleaving research

---

## 5.4 HOOK QUALITY CRITERIA

**What it is:**
Standards for what makes a memory hook effective.

**Good hooks are:**
- **Mechanism-linked** — tied to actual function, not random
- **Simple & vivid** — easy to visualize
- **Personally meaningful** — you created or approved it
- **Stable** — used consistently throughout
- **Retrievable** — works as cue under pressure

**Poor hooks:**
- Random associations not tied to function
- Overly complex metaphors
- Changed frequently
- Imposed without buy-in
- Can't be recalled under stress

**How to apply it:**
- Check each hook against criteria
- Reject/revise hooks that don't meet standards
- Hook Integration Rule: use same hook everywhere
- SOP reference: PES (Personal Encoding Step), Gated Platter

**Research pointers:**
- Elaborative interrogation
- Meaningful vs rote learning
- Transfer-appropriate processing

---

# PART 6: SESSION DESIGN
*Putting it all together*

---

## 6.1 PLANNING BEFORE LEARNING

**What it is:**
Establishing targets, gathering materials, and creating a plan BEFORE teaching starts.

**Why it works:**
- Reduces decision fatigue during learning
- Ensures you have what you need
- Pre-testing primes the learning
- Planning quality predicts engagement

**How to apply it:**
- Target: What exam/block? How much time?
- Materials: LOs, slides, labs, practice questions
- Source-Lock: Specific pages/files for today
- Plan: 3-5 steps
- Pre-test: 1-3 questions or brain dump
- SOP reference: M0 Planning (8-step protocol)

**Pitfalls:**
- Skipping planning ("just start")
- Over-planning (spending all time here)
- Not source-locking (leads to drift)

**Research pointers:**
- Pre-testing effects (Pan & Carpenter 2023)
- Implementation intentions
- Goal setting research

---

## 6.2 DIFFICULTY PROGRESSION (FADING)

**What it is:**
Gradually reducing support as learner gains competence.

**Why it works:**
- Scaffolding prevents overwhelm early
- Removing scaffolds forces independent processing
- Matches support to current ability

**How to apply it:**
1. Worked example (full solution shown)
2. Completion problem (finish the solution)
3. Independent problem (solve fully)
4. Spaced retrieval (later review)

Level progression:
- L1 (Metaphor) → L2 (10-year-old) → L3 (High School) → L4 (Clinical)
- Gate: Must teach-back at L2 before unlocking L4

SOP reference: M4 Build practice ladder, Level gating

**Pitfalls:**
- Jumping to independence too fast
- Staying scaffolded too long
- Not gating advancement

**Research pointers:**
- Faded worked examples (Renkl)
- Zone of proximal development
- Scaffolding research

---

## 6.3 SESSION WRAP / CONSOLIDATION

**What it is:**
End-of-session activities that lock in learning and prepare for next time.

**Why it works:**
- Final retrieval strengthens memory
- Identifying gaps guides future study
- Scheduling review prevents forgetting
- Cards capture weak points for spaced practice

**How to apply it:**
Exit ticket (final 10 min):
1. Blurt — 2 min free recall, notes closed
2. Muddiest point — one concept still fuzzy
3. Next action hook — first action for next session

Then:
- Create cards for weak anchors
- Log metrics (calibration, RSR, load type)
- Schedule spaced reviews (1-3-7-21)
- SOP reference: M6 Wrap protocol

**Pitfalls:**
- Skipping wrap ("ran out of time")
- No cards for weak points
- Not scheduling next review
- Not tracking progress (lose your place)

**Research pointers:**
- Testing effect at end of session
- Implementation intentions for follow-up
- Spaced retrieval scheduling

---

## 6.4 MODE SELECTION

**What it is:**
Choosing the right learning approach based on current state and material.

**Why it works:**
- Different states need different approaches
- New material ≠ review ≠ weak spot repair
- Matching mode to need improves efficiency

**The modes:**
| State | Mode | Behavior |
|-------|------|----------|
| New to material | Core | AI guides, full encode cycle |
| Seen it, test me | Sprint | Test-first, teach only on miss |
| Short time (10-15 min) | Light | Micro-session, minimal wrap |
| Timed burst (20-30 min) | Quick Sprint | Fast testing + required wrap |
| Keep missing specific thing | Drill | Deep focus on weak spot |

**Switching heuristics:**
- Core → Sprint: ~80% confident
- Sprint → Drill: repeated misses cluster
- Sprint → Core: understanding shaky
- Any → break: fatigue signals

SOP reference: M5 Modes

**Pitfalls:**
- Always using same mode
- Core mode when you should be testing (Sprint)
- Sprint mode when you don't understand (need Core)

**Research pointers:**
- Mastery learning
- Test-potentiated learning
- Adaptive learning systems
