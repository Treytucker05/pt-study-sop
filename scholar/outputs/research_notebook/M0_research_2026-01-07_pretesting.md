## 1. Question / Rabbit Hole

Does taking a test *before* learning new information (pre-testing) actually improve long-term retention in a high-volume medical curriculum?

## 2. Why it matters for Tutor/SOP

The Tutor currently defaults to "Teaching-First" in Core Mode. If pre-testing is superior, we should shift the M0/M1/M2 boundary toward a forced "Probe" before any instruction is delivered.

## 3. Findings Summary

- **The Pre-testing Effect**: Taking a test before exposure to content enhances subsequent retention compared to no retrieval practice (even if the pre-test answers are wrong).
- **Mechanism**: It encourages "feedback-seeking behaviors," identifies knowledge gaps, and directs attention to relevant information during the subsequent learning phase.
- **Diagnostic Value**: Pre-tests increase curiosity and alertness to knowledge gaps (metacognition).
- **Comparison**: While post-testing (after learning) is stronger for pure retention over 7 days, pre-tests excel at *priming* the mind for new encoding and reducing "Illusion of Knowledge."
