# No-Input Research Protocol (2026-01-12)

## Purpose
Maintain continuous research that surfaces new questions and improvements even without fresh user input.

## Sources Strategy
- Use a rotating set of pedagogy and PT education sources (journals, guidelines, evidence summaries).
- Track source URLs and citations in each research note.

## Query Cadence
- Daily: one narrow question tied to a specific module or gap.
- Weekly: one broad review question tied to system health weaknesses.

## Evidence Logging
- Each research note should include: source, date accessed, key findings (5-10 bullets), and direct evidence links.
- Store notes under `scholar/outputs/research_notebook/` with a consistent name.

## How Research Becomes Questions
- Each research note must include 1-3 questions for the Tutor/Brain/SOP system.
- Those questions are appended to `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/questions_needed_<run>.md` during the next run.

## Output Format (suggested)
- Title, Source, Date
- Key Findings (bullets)
- Implications for Tutor/SOP
- Questions to Answer Next
