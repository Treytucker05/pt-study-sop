## 1. Question / Rabbit Hole

Does using phonetic sound-alikes (KWIK) before semantic meaning (M-series) in anatomy learning lead to "Keyword-only recall" where the student knows the trigger but not the function?

## 2. Why it matters for Tutor/SOP

KWIK (v9.2) puts "Sound" as Step 1. Some evidence suggests semantic encoding should be the primary lead for long-term retention.

## 3. Findings Summary

- **Dual Coding Theory**: Learning is significantly enhanced when verbal and visual systems are engaged simultaneously (diagrams + labels + function).
- **Levels of Processing**: Semantic encoding (meaning/function) is superior to phonetic encoding (sound) for LTM.
- **Phonetic Mnemonics**: Effectively store lists but rely on proficiency. "Sound" cues can lead to shallower processing if not immediately anchored to "Function."
- **Expertise Reversal**: Extensive mnemonic scaffolding can become "redundant load" as the student gains expertise.

## 5. Actionable Takeaway?

- **Yes:** Modify KWIK to mandate "Function" resonance *before* "Sound" creation, or at least concurrently. (Promotion 후보: RFC-20260107-KWIK-REFINE).
