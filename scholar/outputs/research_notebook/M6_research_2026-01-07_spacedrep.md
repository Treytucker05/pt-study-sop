## 1. Question / Rabbit Hole

What is the optimal interval and repetition strategy for "Successive Relearning" in a high-volume medical curriculum?

## 2. Why it matters for Tutor/SOP

The current M6 Wrap uses a 1-3-7 day schedule. We need to verify if this is optimal or if we should move to "Mastery Gating" (Successive Relearning).

## 3. Findings Summary

- **The Spacing Effect**: Distributed learning is significantly superior to massed practice for long-term retention and surgical skills.
- **Successive Relearning**: Requires 2-3 correct recalls across spaced sessions before a concept is considered "mastered." This is more effective than simple spacing.
- **Micro-efficiency**: Platforms like Anki are widely used in USMLE prep; however, spaced repetition is less suitable for *initial* learning of novel concepts (initial encoding needs interactive scaffolding).
- **Double-Spaced Repetition**: Some evidence suggests a double-repetition at each node (Review-Review-Wait) is superior for knowledge transfer.

## 5. Actionable Takeaway?

- **Yes:** Modify M6 to include a "Mastery Count" (n=3) for anchors. (Promotion Candidate: RFC-20260107-SR-MASTERY).
