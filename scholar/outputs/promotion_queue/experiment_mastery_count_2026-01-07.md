# Experiment Design — Mastery Count Tracking

- Exp ID: EXP-20260107-004
- Linked RFC: RFC-20260107-004

## 1. Hypothesis

Explicitly tracking Mastery (1-3) will increase the long-term retention of anchors by 30% compared to simple 1-3-7 day scheduling.

## 2. Variables

- **Independent Variable**: Log format (Mastery-Counted vs Date-Only).
- **Dependent Variables**:
  - Long-term recall rate (>14 days).
  - Student "Sensation of Mastery" (qualitative).

## 3. Implementation

- AI prompts for the "Mastery Level" during M6 Wrap for each anchor.

## 4. Success Criteria

- [X] Decrease in "Re-study" frequency for the same topic.
- [X] High student satisfaction with the "Progress Bar" effect of the counter.

## 5. Rollback Criteria

- Wrap session duration increases by >5 min due to bookkeeping.
- Student starts "gaming" the count (falsely reporting mastery).
