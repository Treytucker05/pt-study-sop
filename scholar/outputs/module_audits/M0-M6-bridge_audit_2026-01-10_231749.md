# Module Audit - M0-M6 + bridges (2026-01-10_231749)

## Scope
- Audit window: 2026-01-03 to 2026-01-10
- Session logs in window: none
- Fallback sample (outside window):
  - 2025-12-11_geriatrics_normal_vs_common_abnormal.md
  - 2025-12-10_exam3_final_prep.md
  - 2025-12-08_lower_limb_anatomy.md
  - 2025-12-08_week11_face_encoding.md
  - 2025-12-05_Anatomy_gluteal_region.md
  - 2025_12_05_session_2_module_9.md
- Modes observed: Core
- Safe mode: false

## Facts (from logs)
- L2 teach-back and Sprint quizzes used in geriatrics and exam prep (2025-12-11, 2025-12-10).
- Extraction-Mode -> teach-back -> Sprint loops used for exam prep (2025-12-10).
- Visual-first anatomy anchors and image-first preference noted in gluteal sessions (2025-12-05).
- Lower limb session reports low system performance and requests mind maps, image-first, and one-step M4 Build enforcement (2025-12-08).
- Mechanism vs action confusion noted before Sprint correction (2025-12-11).
- Template-only logs present (2025-12-08_assistant_help.md, 2025-12-09_assistant_help.md).

## Probe-Before-Teach Check
- No explicit pre-probe evidence in sampled logs; 2025-12-11 notes AI taught first due to zero exposure.

## High-Utility Technique Checklist (sample-based)
- Retrieval practice: present (Sprint quizzes/recall gates).
- Spaced practice: not evidenced (Anki creation noted but no spaced sessions logged).
- Elaborative interrogation: not evidenced.
- Self-explanation: present (teach-back, ELI10/ELI4).
- Interleaved practice: not evidenced/unclear.

## Assumptions
- Anki creation implies future spaced practice but is not documented yet.
- Missing pre-probe notes may reflect under-documentation.

## Recommendations (one change each)
1. Add a 60-second pre-probe in Core Mode even with zero exposure to satisfy probe-before-teach.
2. Add a required "Pre-probe attempted? Y/N + evidence" field to the session log template.
3. Add a technique checklist line (retrieval/spaced/elaborative/self-explanation/interleaving) to the session log template.
