## Core Learning Cycle (PEIRRO)

- **Prepare**: Orienting focus before study.
- **Encode**: Building initial memory hooks.
- **Interrogate**: Explaining "why" during encoding.
- **Retrieve**: Recall without looking (Testing Effect).
- **Refine**: Correcting errors after retrieval.
- **Overlearn**: Repeating past mastery for stability.

## Encoding & Knowledge Engineering

- **KWIK**: (Sound-Function-Image-Resonance-Lock) The flow for creating hooks.
- **Seed-Lock**: A user-supplied analogy that anchors a new term.
- **Levels (L1–L4)**: Depth gating (Metaphor, Simple, HS, Clinical).
- **Anchors**: Key concepts identified as "mastered" and pinned for future review.

## Architecture & Guardrails

- **Source Packet**: The raw text pasted by the user as the ground truth.
- **Source-Lock**: The non-negotiable rule to stay within the Source Packet.
- **Gated Platter**: The incremental delivery of aid (hint -> scaffold -> lead) to combat passivity.
- **Anatomy Engine**: The bone-first, landmark-led flow for OIANA+ Mastery.
- **Concept Engine**: The definition-to-application flow for theoretical topics.

## Modes

- **Core**: Deep architectural learning (heavy scaffolding).
- **Sprint**: Fast-paced retrieval testing (no teaching unless missed).
- **Drill**: Targeting specific weak anchors based on prior misses.
- **Light**: Reduced-duration sessions with low cognitive overhead.

## Scholar Concepts

- **Promotion Queue**: The lane for bounded, testable system improvements.
- **Research Notebook**: The lane for unbounded pedagogical exploration.
- **Dossier**: A deep-dive audit and research report for a single module.
