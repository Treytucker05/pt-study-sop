# Scholar Audit Digest (2026-01-12)

## Key Findings
- Scholar has clear workflows, agents, and output lanes, with strong separation from production sources.
- Documentation and output lanes are misaligned in a few places.
- Execution depends on Codex CLI and Brain telemetry availability.

## Gaps
- Limited automated validation of output coverage and freshness.
- Documentation does not enumerate all active output lanes.

## Working Status
- Evidence of recent outputs exists; full runability requires verifying a new orchestrator run.
