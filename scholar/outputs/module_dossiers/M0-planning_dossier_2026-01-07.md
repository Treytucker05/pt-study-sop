- Phase: M0 Planning
- Last Updated: 2026-01-07

## 1. Operational Contract

- **Purpose:** Establish targets, source-lock, and plan of attack before cognitive work begins.
- **Trigger(s):** Session start, `plan` command.
- **Required Inputs:** Exam target, time available, materials available.
- **Required Outputs:** Plan of Attack (3–5 steps), Source-Lock confirmation.
- **Exit Criteria:** Target defined; Sources locked; 1–3 item pre-test (PRIME) completed.
- **Failure Modes / Drift Risks:** Over-planning (bloat); proceeding without explicit Source-Lock; skipping the pre-test brain dump.

## 2. Pedagogy Mapping

- **Retrieval Practice:** [PARTIAL] - M0 includes a 1-3 item "PRIME" (pre-test), but it is often treated as optional or a "brain dump" rather than a hard gate.
- **Spacing/Interleaving:** [PASS] - Planning requires positioning relative to prior sessions.
- **Cognitive Load:** [PASS] - Goal-setting reduces extraneous load during the loop.
- **Metacognition:** [PASS] - "Position" check forces students to estimate readiness.

## 3. Evidence Map

- **Pre-testing Effect**: Pre-tests direct attention and enhance subsequent encoding even if initial attempts fail (Source: Psychonomic Society 2024).
- **Self-Regulated Learning (Zimmerman)**: "Forethought" is the critical first stage of the cycle (Source: M-SRL Framework).

## 4. Improvement Candidates (Rabbit Holes Allowed)

- Integrate a "Search for Prior Errors" step into Planning to force interleaving of weak points.
- Default to "Light Mode" defaults for short sessions to reduce setup friction.

## 5. Promotion Candidates (MAX 3)

1. **[Mandatory Pre-test Gate]**: Strengthen the PRIME step to require a correct or "best effort" retrieval attempt on a core prerequisite before unlocking M1.
2. **[Source-Lock Verification]**: Require the AI to list the Top 3 "Forbidden Topics" (not in source) to ensure grounding.

## 6. Guardrails (What Must Not Change)

- Source-Lock: Facts must come only from the selected materials.
- Brain Schema: The planning fields must remain compatible with the log template.
