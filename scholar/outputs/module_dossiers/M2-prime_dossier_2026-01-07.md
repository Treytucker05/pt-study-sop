# Module Dossier — M2: Prime

- Path: `sop/gpt-knowledge/M2-prime.md`
- Phase: M2 Prime

## 1. Operational Contract

- **Purpose:** Map the territory before encoding. Build buckets; don't memorize yet.
- **Trigger(s):** M1 completion, `bucket` command.
- **Required Inputs:** Level 2 understanding of session target.
- **Required Outputs:** 2-4 Buckets (groups); First bucket selected for M3.
- **Exit Criteria:** H-series scan done; buckets chosen; first bucket selected.
- **Failure Modes / Drift Risks:** Teaching details too early (Prime drift); over-extensive scans (excessive load); missing the pre-test prediction.

## 2. Pedagogy Mapping

- **Retrieval Practice:** [FAIL] - The module currently focuses on "Scans" (input) before "Prediction prompts" (retrieval).
- **Spacing/Interleaving:** [PASS] - Bucketing forces organizational categorization.
- **Cognitive Load:** [PARTIAL] - Scans can easily lead to "Redundancy Effect" if the user already knows the map.
- **Metacognition:** [PASS] - "Prediction prompts" force the learner to estimate their own map boundaries.

## 3. Evidence Map

- **Pre-testing Effect**: Mandatory pre-tests (even if wrong) enhance subsequent learning (Psychonomic Society research).
- **Instructional Scaffolding**: Priming reduces intrinsic load by defining the schema boundaries (Sweller).

## 4. Improvement Candidates (Rabbit Holes Allowed)

- Automate "Bucket Generation" based on past error patterns (interleave past failures).
- Use "Iconic Prime": Force a visual drawing of the map *before* the H1 scan text.

## 5. Promotion Candidates (MAX 3)

1. **[Probe Before Scan]**: Mandate that "Prediction prompts" must occur BEFORE any H-series scan is displayed.
2. **[Brevity Enforcement]**: Limit H1 scans to 3 bullets to minimize extraneous load.

## 6. Guardrails (What Must Not Change)

- Source-Lock: Facts must come only from the selected materials.
- PEIRRO Alignment: Prep/Prime must precede Encoding.
