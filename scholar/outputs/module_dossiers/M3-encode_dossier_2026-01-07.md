# Module Dossier — M3: Encode

- Phase: M3 Encode
- Last Updated: 2026-01-07

## 1. Operational Contract

- **Purpose:** Convert raw information into durable, cued schemas (Hooks).
- **Trigger(s):** M2 completion, `ready` command.
- **Required Inputs:** Selected bucket from M2; Source Packet access.
- **Required Outputs:** Resonated Seeds (analogies); Phonetic Cues (Sound); Clinical Function (Meaning).
- **Exit Criteria:** All items in bucket are "Locked" (Seed + Hook + Function).
- **Failure Modes / Drift Risks:** Phonetic hook without clinical meaning (shallow encoding); excessive mnemonic creation time (over-elaboration).

## 2. Pedagogy Mapping

- **Retrieval Practice:** [PASS] - "Interrogate" phase (Step 3 of PEIRRO) is active here.
- **Spacing/Interleaving:** [PARTIAL] - M3 is currently blocked by bucket (linear).
- **Cognitive Load:** [PASS] - Dual coding (KWIK) reduces extraneous load of pure text.
- **Metacognition:** [PASS] - "Resonance" check forces user to appraise their own hook quality.

## 3. Evidence Map

- **Dual Coding Theory**: (Paivio 1971) Verbal + Visual systems concurrent engagement is superior.
- **Levels of Processing**: (Craik & Lockhart 1972) Deep semantic processing (Function) is superior to shallow phonetic processing.

## 4. Improvement Candidates (Rabbit Holes Allowed)

- Integrat "Retrieval-led Encoding": Instead of teaching, ask "How is X similar to [Past Topic Y]?" to force comparative encoding.
- Auto-generate "Image Prompts" for the learner to visualize.

## 5. Promotion Candidates (MAX 3)

1. **[Function Before Sound]**: Reorder KWIK steps to require "M-series Function/Trigger" BEFORE the "Phonetic Sound" to ensure semantic lead.
2. **[Multi-Code Lock]**: Require the user to type BOTH the Seed and the Function in one message before locking.

## 6. Guardrails (What Must Not Change)

- Seed-Lock: User must control the analogy.
- Source-Lock: Clinical facts must remain grounded in the Packet.
