# Scholar Orchestrator Run - 2026-01-11
- Run ID: 2026-01-11_auto
- Mode: Unattended
- Safe Mode: False (audit_manifest.json)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Audit recent session logs (last 7 days or since last run).
2. Apply Probe-Before-Teach and High-Utility Technique checklist.
3. Produce one artifact for M0-M6 + bridges.
4. Update run log with required sections and weekly digest if triggered.
5. Respect read-only guardrails for sop/, brain/, dist/.

## Actions Completed
1. Initialized run
   - Created questions_needed_2026-01-11.md
   - Verified audit_manifest.json: safe_mode = false
2. Audited session logs
   - Window: 2026-01-04 to 2026-01-11
   - No session logs in window; fallback sample used (2025-12-05 to 2025-12-11)
3. Phase 2 Research
   - Skipped (no research questions triggered)
4. Synthesized artifact
   - Created module audit for M0-M6 + bridges
5. Weekly digest
   - Triggered (Sunday); created weekly_digest_2026-01-11.md

## Artifacts Produced
1. Module Audit: scholar/outputs/module_audits/M0-M6-bridge_audit_2026-01-11.md
2. Questions Needed: scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/questions_needed_2026-01-11.md
3. Weekly Digest: scholar/outputs/reports/weekly_digest_2026-01-11.md

## Status
- Run completed
- Mandatory artifact produced
- Read-only paths respected (sop/, brain/, dist/)

### What I Learned This Run (5 bullets max)
- No session logs in the last 7 days; audit used a fallback sample from 2025-12-05 to 2025-12-11.
- Probe-before-teach is not documented; one session explicitly notes AI taught first due to zero exposure.
- Retrieval practice and self-explanation appear; spaced practice, elaborative interrogation, and interleaving are not evidenced.
- Data quality issues persist (template-only logs, duplicate or overlapping entries).
- Anatomy sessions repeatedly request image-first workflows and micro-step enforcement.

### Action Items
- ⚡ Confirm whether fallback audits should be the default when the 7-day window is empty.
- ⚡ Decide whether a pre-probe is required even with zero prior exposure.

### Warnings
- ⚠️ No session logs within the last 7 days; findings rely on a 2025-12-05 to 2025-12-11 fallback.
- ⚠️ Template-only logs in brain/session_logs reduce audit signal quality.
