# Questions Needed - 2026-01-10_231749

- Should audits use a fallback to the most recent prior session when the 7-day window is empty, or use strict empty-window reporting only?
- Should the session log template require a "Pre-probe attempted? Y/N + evidence" field to enforce probe-before-teach documentation?
- Should technique checklist coverage be explicitly captured in session logs (checkboxes) instead of inferred from reflections?
