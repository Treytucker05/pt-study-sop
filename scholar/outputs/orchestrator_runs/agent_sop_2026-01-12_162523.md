**Ledger Snapshot**
- Goal: Audit SOP coverage and adherence vs Master Plan using allowlisted files (read-only).
- Now: Reviewed allowlisted SOP files; preparing audit output; `CONTINUITY.md` not updated due to READ-ONLY constraint.
- Next: Deliver audit summary, gaps, mismatches, questions, and recommended next checks.
- Open Questions: UNCONFIRMED - telemetry snapshot missing; canonical study_mode values and closeout output format unresolved (see Questions Needed).

## Summary
Allowlisted runtime canon largely reinforces Master Plan invariants: MAP->LOOP->WRAP structure, Seed-Lock/level gating, and source-locked RAG-first teaching are explicit in `sop/MASTER_PLAN_PT_STUDY.md`, `sop/gpt-knowledge/gpt-instructions.md`, `sop/gpt-knowledge/M0-planning.md`, `sop/gpt-knowledge/PEIRRO.md`, and `sop/gpt-knowledge/notebooklm-bridge.md`. Deterministic wrap logging is mandated via JSON outputs in `sop/gpt-knowledge/M6-wrap.md`, but internal inconsistencies around study-mode labels and closeout formats reduce contract clarity. Telemetry was not provided, so adherence to observed behavior cannot be verified.

## Coverage Gaps
- SOP content outside the allowlist was not reviewed, including `sop/modules/`, `sop/methods/`, `sop/frameworks/`, and `sop/examples/`.
- Runtime canon index/ordering files under `sop/gpt-knowledge/` not in the allowlist were not reviewed, so precedence/conflict resolution across canon is unverified.
- Operational SOPs and repo-wide guidance in `docs/` and `README.md` were not reviewed for alignment with Master Plan invariants.
- Telemetry/dashboard artifacts were not provided, so observability and gating adherence in practice is unverified.

## Contract Mismatches
- UNCONFIRMED: No telemetry snapshot provided; mismatches below are internal SOP contract inconsistencies that would likely surface in behavior/logging.
- Planning/source-lock gating conflict: `sop/gpt-knowledge/M0-planning.md` and `sop/gpt-knowledge/gpt-instructions.md` forbid teaching without target/sources/plan and require NotebookLM sources, while `sop/gpt-knowledge/runtime-prompt.md` offers a "Quick Question" direct-answer path that skips planning; this undermines the RAG-first invariant in `sop/MASTER_PLAN_PT_STUDY.md`.
- Study-mode enumeration conflicts: `sop/gpt-knowledge/M6-wrap.md` requires mode = Core/Sprint/Drill, `sop/gpt-knowledge/M5-modes.md` and `sop/gpt-knowledge/runtime-prompt.md` add Light and Quick Sprint, and `sop/gpt-knowledge/brain-session-log-template.md` uses Diagnostic Sprint/Teaching Sprint; this risks schema drift for study_mode logging in `sop/MASTER_PLAN_PT_STUDY.md`.
- Closeout output format ambiguity: `sop/gpt-knowledge/M6-wrap.md` mandates two JSON outputs for Brain ingestion, while `sop/gpt-knowledge/brain-session-log-template.md` states the canonical closeout is a markdown session log; unclear which is authoritative for deterministic logging.

## Questions Needed
- Which closeout output is authoritative for ingestion: the two JSON objects in `sop/gpt-knowledge/M6-wrap.md`, the markdown session log in `sop/gpt-knowledge/brain-session-log-template.md`, or both with defined precedence?
- What are the canonical study_mode values for logging/ingestion, and should Light/Quick Sprint and Sprint subtypes map to Core/Sprint/Drill?
- Is the "Quick Question" path in `sop/gpt-knowledge/runtime-prompt.md` intended to bypass planning/source-lock, or should it be constrained to non-factual guidance only?
- Should the Concept Engine be treated as canonical despite the "non-canonical reference" header in `sop/gpt-knowledge/concept-engine.md`?

## Recommended Next Checks
- `sop/gpt-knowledge/README.md` and any canon ordering index (if present) to confirm precedence and conflict resolution within Runtime Canon.
- `sop/modules/` for module-level contracts and how they map to MAP->LOOP->WRAP and PEIRRO.
- `sop/methods/` and `sop/frameworks/` to verify additional invariants, mode naming, and encoding/priming requirements.
- `sop/examples/` for sample session outputs to reconcile M6 JSON vs session log template expectations.
