Ledger Snapshot
- Goal: Run Scholar Orchestrator unattended per runbook for this repo.
- Now: Run complete; outputs written and logged.
- Next: Await direction for next run or follow-up.
- Open Questions: Should Core Mode mandate a minimal pre-probe even with zero prior exposure?

Completed the unattended run: audited available logs (none in last 7 days), used the latest fallback session, produced a module audit, logged the run with required sections, and generated the weekly digest because it’s Friday. Research was skipped because the existing pretesting note already covers the open question.

Files created/updated:

Notes:
- Audit window had no recent session logs; findings rely on `brain/session_logs/2025-12-11_geriatrics_normal_vs_common_abnormal.md`.
- No new web research was run; referenced `scholar/outputs/research_notebook/M0_research_2026-01-07_pretesting.md`.

Next steps (pick one):
1. Review and approve the Core Mode pre-probe decision captured in `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/questions_needed_2026-01-09_225619.md`.
2. Review the audit recommendations in `scholar/outputs/module_audits/M0-M6-bridge_audit_2026-01-09.md`.
3. Run another unattended cycle with a different module focus.
