# Orchestrator Run Summary — 2026-01-07 (Example)

- Run ID: RUN-20260107-EXAMPLE
- Status: Simulated Completion
- Scanned: 24 files
- Mode: Audit & Model

## 1. Scope Chosen

- **Target Component**: M1 Entry & M4 Build
- **Focus**: Improving energy heuristics and clinical depth layering.

## 2. Questions Generated

- **M1-Q1**: What is the physiological basis for the "Energy Check" threshold in medical student fatigue models?
- **M1-Q2**: How does the Tutor verify focus state beyond simple user self-reporting?
- **M4-Q1**: In anatomy education, what is the optimal "Lead Time" between learning a structure and applying its clinical correlation?
- **M4-Q2**: Does "Drawing first" (M4 requirement) align with the Expertise Reversal effect for senior residents?

## 3. Triggered Research

- **Research Note 2026-01-07-A**: "Fatigue levels and cognitive load in medical trainees" (Literature Search).
- **Research Note 2026-01-07-B**: "Visual vs Verbal lead times in surgical anatomy learning" (Literature Search).

## 4. Synthesis Results (Simulated)

- **Dossier Updates**:
  - `M1-entry_dossier_2026-01-07.md`: Added evidence for "Circadian alignment" in study scheduling.
  - `M4-build_dossier_2026-01-07.md`: Added evidence for "Clinical-First" encoding for senior students.

## 5. Promotion Candidates drafted

- **RFC-20260107-M1**: Adaptive Energy Thresholds.
- **RFC-20260107-M4**: Clinical-First Bypass mode for Seniors.
- **Patch Draft**: [patch_draft_M4_senior_bypass.md](file:///c:/Users/treyt/OneDrive/Desktop/pt-study-sop/scholar/outputs/promotion_queue/patch_draft_M4_senior_bypass_2026-01-07.md)

## 6. Coverage Report
