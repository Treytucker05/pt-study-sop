**Ledger Snapshot**
- Goal: Telemetry audit for run 2026-01-12_162523 (CONTINUITY.md update skipped: READ-ONLY)
- Now: Produce report from provided telemetry (none provided)
- Next: Await telemetry snapshot or deep-check paths
- Open Questions: See Questions Needed

## Summary
Telemetry snapshot content is missing, so system health is indeterminate from this run. The primary signal here is an observability gap rather than a measured trend. Treat this as a data-availability incident until confirmed otherwise.

## Signals
- 0 telemetry records provided in input (no events, metrics, or timestamps to analyze).
- 0 study activity signals available to assess plan → learn → log → review flow.

## Risks
- Ingestion or export pipeline failure could be masking real regressions.
- Stale or absent telemetry blocks detection of drop-offs, gaps, or compliance drift.

## Questions Needed
- Provide the latest telemetry snapshot (time range, total events, counts by event type).
- Are there known ingestion/export errors or recent pipeline changes?
- Should READ-ONLY runs skip updating `CONTINUITY.md`, or is there a preferred mechanism?

## Recommended Next Checks
- Export last 30 days of study events by type (lecture/reading/quiz/exam/assignment/other) and totals.
- Verify latest event timestamp and total row counts in `brain/data/pt_study.db`.
- Review ingestion logs or pipeline status for the latest successful run ID.
