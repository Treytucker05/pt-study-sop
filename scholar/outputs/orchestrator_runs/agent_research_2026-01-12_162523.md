Ledger Snapshot: Goal: Complete remaining Ralph stories (US-006..US-020) for Scholar loop integration; Now: Begin US-007 (gaps -> improvements lifecycle report); Next: Continue US-007..US-009 after US-006; Open Questions: None.
Note: READ-ONLY run, so `CONTINUITY.md` was not updated.

## Summary
Telemetry is missing, so the highest-value direction is to reconstruct expected telemetry and evidence coverage from canon/SOP artifacts before mapping gaps; recommendation is to request the telemetry snapshot and SOP allowlist, then align gap questions to loop-phase evidence.

## Research Questions
- Which loop phases (questions, proposals, gaps, digests, system health) lack telemetry evidence in the latest run, and what events would prove coverage?
- What minimal event set is needed to detect regressions in the study flow (plan -> learn -> log -> review)?
- How should telemetry differentiate Core, Sprint, Drill modes to maintain invariant tracking?
- Which syllabus event types (lecture, reading, quiz, exam, assignment, other) should be explicitly instrumented for gap detection?
- What SOP-defined artifacts are required to justify a “gap -> improvement” promotion, and how should telemetry reference them?

## Proposed Evidence Sources
- Runtime Canon: `sop/gpt-knowledge/` (expected loop artifacts and rules)
- Master Plan: `sop/MASTER_PLAN_PT_STUDY.md` (invariants and contracts)
- Scholar outputs: `scholar/outputs/` lane artifacts (gaps/digests/system health)
- Brain data schemas: `brain/` (event tracking and analytics data model)
- Learning science: retrieval practice and self-regulated learning telemetry patterns (e.g., Dunlosky 2013, Winne 2017)

## Initial Findings (if any)
- Fact: No telemetry snapshot provided in this run header, so gap-to-telemetry mapping cannot be verified.
- Fact: `rg` search for "telemetry" in `sop/` returned no matches, suggesting telemetry expectations live elsewhere (or are implicit).
- Fact: `CONTINUITY.md` indicates current focus on gaps -> improvements lifecycle (US-007), aligning research priority to gap evidence coverage.
- Problem framing: Without telemetry, we can only infer gaps from SOP artifacts and prior outputs, risking misalignment with actual instrumentation.
- Constraints: READ-ONLY; SOP scope allowlist not provided (UNCONFIRMED); telemetry schema unknown.
- Options: A) Reconstruct expected telemetry from canon + outputs; B) Wait for snapshot/allowlist then map directly; C) Define a minimal “must-have” event set and validate later.
- Trade-offs table:
  - A | fast start | inference-heavy | risk of drift | choose if schedule tight
  - B | accurate | delays progress | blocking risk | choose if precision required
  - C | pragmatic | may miss nuances | partial coverage | choose for early alignment
- Recommendation: Request telemetry snapshot + SOP allowlist, then perform a tight mapping to loop-phase evidence; meanwhile draft a minimal event checklist tied to gap promotion artifacts.

## Questions Needed
- Can you provide the telemetry snapshot (events, metrics, sample rows) for the target run?
- What is the SOP scope allowlist for this research run?
- Which timeframe or release window should the gap analysis cover?
