# Scholar Docs and Templates Audit (2026-01-12)

## Governance Docs
- `scholar/README.md` (Quickstart)
- `scholar/CHARTER.md` (identity, outputs, rules)

## Templates
- `C:/Users/treyt/OneDrive/Desktop/pt-study-sop/scholar/TEMPLATES/audit_report.md`
- `C:/Users/treyt/OneDrive/Desktop/pt-study-sop/scholar/TEMPLATES/change_proposal.md`
- `C:/Users/treyt/OneDrive/Desktop/pt-study-sop/scholar/TEMPLATES/experiment_design.md`
- `C:/Users/treyt/OneDrive/Desktop/pt-study-sop/scholar/TEMPLATES/gap_analysis.md`
- `C:/Users/treyt/OneDrive/Desktop/pt-study-sop/scholar/TEMPLATES/module_dossier.md`
- `C:/Users/treyt/OneDrive/Desktop/pt-study-sop/scholar/TEMPLATES/patch_draft.md`
- `C:/Users/treyt/OneDrive/Desktop/pt-study-sop/scholar/TEMPLATES/research_note.md`
- `C:/Users/treyt/OneDrive/Desktop/pt-study-sop/scholar/TEMPLATES/system_map.md`

## Noted Mismatches
- Output lanes in docs do not enumerate all lanes observed under `scholar/outputs/` (see `scholar/outputs/STATUS.md` and `scholar/outputs/`).
- Charter output contract focuses on reports/proposals but outputs include module audits, digests, gap analyses, and orchestrator runs.
