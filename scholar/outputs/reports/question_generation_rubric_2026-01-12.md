# Question Generation Rubric (2026-01-12)

## Criteria (must meet 2+)
- Evidence-based: anchored to a specific artifact or research note.
- Actionable: answer can change a plan, SOP module, or workflow.
- Non-duplicate: not answered in latest `questions_resolved_*.md`.
- Scope-bound: tied to a specific module, system, or known gap.

## Tagging Rules
- Tag by system: Brain, Tutor, Scholar, Dashboard/Loop, Telemetry/Data.
- Tag by artifact: health, research, gaps, proposals, digests, plans.

## Threshold for Adding a Question
- Add only if it can be answered with available evidence or a defined research step.
- If evidence is missing, log a research action in `research_notebook/`.

## Question Types -> System Traits / Gaps
- Health gap questions -> system health "Under Development" items.
- Research questions -> research_notebook findings.
- Workflow questions -> dashboard wiring and loop artifacts.
- Data questions -> telemetry freshness and ingestion gaps.
