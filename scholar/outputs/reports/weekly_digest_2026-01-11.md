# Weekly Digest - 2026-01-11

## Scope
- Window: 2026-01-04 to 2026-01-11 (last 7 days)
- Session logs in window: none
- Fallback sample: 7 sessions from 2025-12-05 to 2025-12-11 (Core and Sprint)
- Data quality notes: 2 template-only logs and 1 duplicate not counted in stats

## Patterns Across Sessions
- Visual-first anatomy anchors are consistently effective and preferred.
- Sprint/MCQ loops surface misconceptions quickly, but pre-probe steps are not documented.
- Several logs miss planning or rating fields; source-lock drift appears in one Sprint session.
- Lower limb session flagged missing mind maps, image-first steps, and micro-step enforcement.
- Spaced, elaborative, and interleaved techniques are not explicitly logged.

## Technique Usage Stats (sample-based)
- Retrieval practice: 4/7 sessions (Sprint MCQs or recall gates).
- Spaced practice: 0/7 sessions (Anki creation noted, no spaced sessions logged).
- Elaborative interrogation: 0/7 sessions.
- Self-explanation: 2/7 sessions (teach-back, ELI10/ELI4).
- Interleaved practice: 0/7 sessions (unclear).

## Top Recommendations
1. Add a pre-probe documentation field to the session log template to enforce Probe-Before-Teach.
2. Add a technique checklist line to the session log template to track Dunlosky usage.
3. Block template-only logs at ingest to keep audit signals clean.
