# Experiment Design — <TITLE>

- Experiment ID:
- Date:
- Owner: The Scholar
- Related Change Proposal ID:
- Target System: Tutor v9.2 (production) or Tutor Sandbox (specify)

## 1) Hypothesis (one sentence)

- If we <change X>, then <metric Y> will improve because <reason>.

## 2) Intervention (ONE variable only)

- Control condition (current behavior):
- Test condition (new behavior):
- What is held constant:

## 3) Participants / Context

- Who is using it:
- Course / exam context:
- Time window constraints (e.g., overnight shifts allowed):

## 4) Procedure (step-by-step)

- Session protocol to follow:
- When to collect logs:
- When to do next-day recall checks:

## 5) Metrics (operational definitions)

### Primary metric (choose one)

Examples:

- Next-day recall accuracy (%)
- Error recurrence rate by category (Conceptual/Discrimination/Recall)
- Time-to-correct (minutes until correct on retest)

Define:

- How it is measured
- Where it is recorded (Brain log fields)

### Secondary metrics

- Session completion rate
- Perceived friction (1–5)
- Confidence delta (pre vs post)

## 6) Sample size / duration

- Planned N sessions:
- Planned duration (days/weeks):
- Minimum data required to decide:

## 7) Success Criteria (must be numeric)

- Success threshold:
- Partial success threshold:
- No-change threshold:

## 8) Stop / Abort Criteria

- Conditions that end the experiment early:
- Safety constraints (don’t harm study throughput):

## 9) Decision & Recommendation

- Outcome: Win / Loss / Inconclusive
- Promote? (Y/N)
- If promote: where change lands
- If not: what to try next

## 10) Appendices

- Links to relevant Brain logs
- Notes
