# Agent Workflow Guidelines

## Startup (New Sessions, Task Unspecified)

1. What do you want to do?
   - A. Create a PRD
   - B. Review/merge AGENTS.md rules
   - C. Other (describe)
2. Which project path?
3. Shell preference? A. WSL/Git Bash  B. PowerShell

## Agent Hygiene

- Clean up after each task: remove failed scripts, temp files, obsolete drafts.
- Mark tasks complete in the relevant plan/ExecPlan and document what changed.
- If a decision changes direction, add a note explaining why.
- When a file becomes outdated, update it or mark deprecated with a pointer.

## Extra Notes

- If unsure, label it `UNCONFIRMED` and ask a targeted question.
- Always list the exact files changed.
