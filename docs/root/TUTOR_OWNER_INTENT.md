# Tutor Owner Intent (Session-Persistent Notes)

Date: 2026-02-22  
Owner: Trey  
Purpose: keep non-negotiable product intent in one place so sessions do not drift.

## Core Intent
- Build a tutor that teaches any learner at any level and makes learning stick long-term.
- Prioritize durable learning and transfer, not short-term performance optics.

## Non-Negotiable Requirements
- The control plane remains category-first:
  - `PRIME -> CALIBRATE -> ENCODE -> REFERENCE -> RETRIEVE -> OVERLEARN`
- Model is `Category -> Method -> Knob -> Chain`.
- Tutor-generated Obsidian notes must include wiki links at creation time (not deferred cleanup).
- For Mind Map:
  - Method = `Mind Map`
  - Knobs include representation modes (for example `ASCII`, `Mermaid`, `Figma`)
  - Default knob for Mind Map = `ASCII` (project override)

## First-Exposure-First Operating Mode
- The default assumption is first exposure:
  - about 90% of sessions are on material not previously seen.
- PRIME must be tutor-led structuring and teaching, not blind testing.
- PRIME should not ask assessment questions.
- The tutor should not ask unsupported knowledge-check questions before giving enough structure to answer.
- CALIBRATE is where assessment questions begin (retrieval + confidence), after minimal primer.
- CALIBRATE should identify gaps without punitive framing.

## Anti-Drift Rules
- Keep category definitions and owner intent as canonical references.
- Do not reinterpret method/knob terms per session.
- Any new product preference from owner must be appended here with date and rationale.
- If a recommendation conflicts with this file, this file wins unless owner explicitly changes it.

## Change Log
- 2026-02-22:
  - Added first-exposure-first requirement.
  - Locked behavior: PRIME teaches and structures before calibration pressure.
  - Locked boundary: PRIME has no scored/assessment questioning; CALIBRATE owns assessment probes.
  - Locked note policy: tutor outputs must include wiki links at generation time.
