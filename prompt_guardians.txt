[TASK CONTEXT]
You are analyzing C:\pt-study-sop to document automation or safeguards related to drift/errors (scripts, CI, etc.). It's read-only.

[OBJECTIVES]
1. List existing automation/validation safeguards (scripts, CI jobs, git hooks, etc.) that guard against drift/errors, describing what they check, how they run, and their location.
2. Note any CI or repo instructions referencing these safeguards (AGENTS, BUILD, etc.).
3. Identify drift types currently unguarded (missing coverage) based on absence of checks.

[CONSTRAINTS]
- Focus on .github/workflows, scripts (in scripts/, dashboard_rebuild/, brain/, docs/), AGENTS instructions, build scripts, etc.
- Prioritize commands or documentation that mention drift/errors or validation.
- Skip untracked directories.

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
Return YAML list with entries:
- name: descriptive label
  location: path
  type: script | workflow | doc
  trigger: how/when it runs
  checks: what specifically is validated
  notes: any relevant details
After listing guards, include section gaps: with bullet list of drift types not currently validated.

[SUCCESS CRITERIA]
Complete when automation safeguards enumerated with details and gaps listed.

use subagents; use bq when asked; explain why; include ASCII diagram when helpful
