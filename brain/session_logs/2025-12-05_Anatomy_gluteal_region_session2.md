## Session Info
- Date: 2025-12-05
- Time: 12:13-13:04
- Duration: 51 minutes
- Study Mode: Core

## Planning Phase
- Target Exam/Block: Module 9 - Gluteal Region & Posterior Thigh
- Source-Lock: Lab images (Module 9 deep gluteals + nerves)
- Plan of Attack: Not recorded

## Topic Coverage
- Main Topic: Anatomy - Gluteal Region & Posterior Thigh (deep gluteals + nerves)
- Subtopics: quadratus femoris; piriformis; superior gemellus; sciatic nerve; posterior femoral cutaneous nerve; deep gluteal neurovascular stack

## Execution Details
- Frameworks Used: Visual-First Anatomy Engine; M4 Build
- Gated Platter Triggered: No
- WRAP Phase Reached: Yes
- Anki Cards Created: 0

## Anatomy-Specific
- Region Covered: Gluteal region and posterior thigh
- Landmarks Mastered: Not recorded
- Muscles Attached: quadratus femoris; piriformis; superior gemellus (review); obturator internus tendon (context)
- OIAN Completed For: Not recorded
- Rollback Events: No
- Drawing Used: Not recorded
- Drawings Completed: Not recorded

## Ratings (1-5 scale)
- Understanding Level: n/a
- Retention Confidence: n/a
- System Performance: n/a
- Calibration Check: n/a

## Anchors Locked
1. Quadratus femoris - "looks like a square"
2. Sciatic nerve - "big tongue between piriformis and superior gemellus"
3. Posterior femoral cutaneous nerve - "smaller tongue that splits like a snake tongue"

## Reflection

### What Worked
- Stayed locked to lab images only (no outside cadavers).
- Visual-first study of deep gluteals + nerves.
- Personal anchors (tongue, snake-tongue, square) improved recognition immediately.

### What Needs Fixing
- Start with a clean lab slide checklist so no time is lost.
- Transition sooner to superior/inferior gluteal nerves & arteries to complete the module.

### Gaps Identified
Not recorded.

### Notes/Insights
- Deep gluteal stack and primary nerves are now mastered for the practical.
- Remaining to finish Module 9 images: nerve to obturator internus, nerve to quadratus femoris, superior/inferior gluteal nerves/arteries.
- Written exam strategy clearer after practice-question review.

## Next Session Priority
- Topic: Finish Module 9 neurovascular: nerve to OI, nerve to QF, sup/inf gluteal nerves & arteries
- Focus: Begin with lab slide checklist; reinforce neurovascular routes and relationships
- Materials Needed: Module 9 lab images; checklist; optional drawing tools
