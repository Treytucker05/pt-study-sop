# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-12

## Codebase Patterns
- Scholar inventories should enumerate output lanes and outputs root files using repo-relative paths.

## Key Files
- scholar/outputs/system_map/scholar_inventory_2026-01-12.md
---
## 2026-01-12 - US-001
- What was implemented
  - Created a full Scholar inventory with directories, key files, output lanes, notable artifacts, and coverage note.
- Files changed
  - scholar/outputs/system_map/scholar_inventory_2026-01-12.md
  - AGENTS.md
- **Learnings:**
  - Inventory docs are easiest to validate when they list every output artifact by lane and include outputs root files.
