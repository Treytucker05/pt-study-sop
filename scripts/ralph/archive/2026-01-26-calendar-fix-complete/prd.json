  "description": "Fix the Calendar AI assistant so it connects to Google Calendar using the existing OAuth credentials/tokens in the repo. The assistant must have full CRUD permissions (add/edit/delete/find) across all calendars, and the calendar layout must display real Google events. The current \"not connected\" message in the AI assistant should only appear when auth is truly missing or expired.",
