# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-13

## Codebase Patterns
- Orchestrator proposal seeds should tie governance changes to coordination/control-loop and mixed-initiative evidence with DOI links.
- Orchestrator runbook requires plan_updates and questions_answered when questions exist; `scripts/run_scholar.bat` runs do not generate plan_updates unless dashboard helpers run.
- `ai_artifacts_manifest.json` defines plan_updates/proposal_seeds/implementation_bundles even when output lanes are missing in `scholar/outputs/`.
- Runbook output formatting expects explicit Action Items/Warn prefixes and Coverage sections; verify run logs for compliance.
- Scholar orchestrator research notes should anchor loop governance to coordination theory, autonomic control loops, and mixed-initiative human-AI guidance with DOI links.
- Brain ingest/resume proposal seeds should separate dedupe, template-validation, and resume-metadata changes into distinct one-change RFCs with data-quality citations.
- Ingest dedupe: CLI `ingest_file` uses `ingested_files` checksums; dashboard `/api/upload` bypasses tracking.
- Brain ingest/resume research notes should anchor evidence to `brain/ingest_session.py`, `brain/generate_resume.py`, and `scholar/outputs/reports/brain_tutor_ingest_map_2026-01-12.md`.
- Tutor Engine research notes should include ITS effectiveness, formative feedback, cognitive load, and retrieval practice sources with DOI links plus a Key Takeaways section.
- Tutor Engine proposal seeds should include retrieval-first, feedback rubric, and telemetry completeness proposals tied to audit/research evidence.
- M6 proposal seeds should cover output schema drift plus recall-first wrap, implementation-intention scheduling, and calibration quick-check proposals with evidence paths.
- M6 dossiers should cite `scholar/outputs/system_map/scholar_inventory_2026-01-12.md` in evidence maps to support full artifact traceability.
- M6 audits should flag JSON-vs-markdown log drift and wrap-toolkit vs fixed-protocol mismatches, plus spacing/calibration enforcement gaps.
- M6 research notes should connect wrap steps to retrieval practice, self-explanation, spacing/successive relearning, calibration, and implementation intentions.
- M5 proposal seeds should align mode menus, include Sprint fail-first protocol clarity, and add explicit switch thresholds.
- M5 dossiers should cite the M5 audit + research note and call out runtime preset drift (Light/Quick Sprint) plus Sprint fail-first protocol details.
- M5 audits should flag drift between runtime time-boxed modes and source Core/Sprint/Drill definitions plus missing Sprint fail-first protocol details.
- M5 research notes should tie mode choice and switching to retrieval practice, productive failure, expertise reversal, and metacognitive monitoring evidence.
- M4 proposal seeds should keep L2 teach-back + Seed-Lock guardrails explicit when aligning ramp/spacing rules.
- M4 dossiers should call out difficulty ramp vs L1-L4 teach-back drift and cite the M4 audit + pedagogy research.
- M4 audits should compare runtime difficulty ramp tooling against source L1-L4 teach-back gates to surface drift.
- M4 pedagogy research should anchor spacing, interleaving, successive relearning, and fading evidence to the M4 difficulty ramp and L2 teach-back gate.
- M3 proposal seeds should address ordering drift and list `sop/gpt-knowledge/KWIK.md` when aligning canonical KWIK sequencing.
- M3 audits should flag KWIK ordering drift (Sound -> Function vs Function-first) and missing self-explanation gates between runtime and source modules.
- M3 dossiers should call out KWIK ordering ambiguity and self-explanation gate drift for alignment.
- M3 pedagogy research should cite dual coding, self-explanation, worked examples, segmenting, and drawing evidence with DOI links.
- Module dossiers should cite the module audit + research note and include a per-lane artifact coverage list.
- Module audits should flag runtime/source drift in guardrails (prediction prompts, scan-length guidance, bucket limits) to avoid inconsistent priming enforcement.
- Research notebook entries should include external citations (DOI links) plus a Scholar artifact coverage note referencing each output lane.
- Scholar automation toggles live in `scholar/inputs/audit_manifest.json` and are surfaced via dashboard UI + `/api/scholar/safe-mode` and `/api/scholar/multi-agent`.
- System health maps: capture signals, pipeline stages, outputs, and consuming surfaces with anchors to system health reports + STATUS.
- Run loop maps: align plan -> learn -> test -> log -> review with MAP -> LOOP -> WRAP; cite runtime canon + dashboard surfaces.
- Dataflow maps: enumerate inputs, transformations, and outputs per major step with evidence paths.
- System map module listings: include runtime canon, source module, and master reference entry.
- Engine path maps: include runtime canon, source engine docs/templates, and Tutor engine code entrypoints.
- Question lifecycle maps: cite questions_needed queues, STATUS index, runbook/run logs, and preserved/backlog/resolved artifacts.
- Proposal lifecycle maps: include promotion_queue staging, approvals/rejections paths, STATUS indexing, metadata sidecars, and `scholar_proposals` DB table.
- Evaluation metrics: Brain dashboard metrics live in `brain/dashboard/stats.py`, resume metrics in `brain/generate_resume.py`, and Scholar operational metrics parse `scholar/outputs/STATUS.md` in `brain/dashboard/scholar.py`.
- M0 audits should compare runtime canon vs source modules to flag drift (PRIME/interleave/glossary scan vs source protocol).
- Module dossiers should cite both runtime canon and source modules to keep drift visible.
- Promotion queue proposal seeds should include Approval Required, one-change-only scope, and a Scholar artifact coverage note.
- Promotion queue coverage notes should include at least one artifact per Scholar output lane for traceability.
- Module audits should include Scholar Artifact Coverage + Coverage Gaps sections with lane references.
- M2 dossiers should align runtime vs source guardrails (scan length, bucket limits, probe-before-scan) to keep improvements traceable.
- M2 proposal seeds should mirror M0/M1 structure and include coverage gaps when M2 logs are sparse.
- (Add learnings as they emerge)

- What was implemented: Authored Tutor Engine best-practices research note with key takeaways, options, recommendations, and citations.
- Files changed: scholar/outputs/research_notebook/tutor_engine_research_2026-01-12.md, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt, AGENTS.md, CONTINUITY.md
- **Learnings:**
  - Patterns discovered: Tutor Engine research should cite ITS effectiveness, formative feedback, cognitive load, and retrieval practice sources tied to mode + RAG guardrails.
  - Gotchas encountered: None.
---
## 2026-01-13 - US-040
- What was implemented: Audited Tutor Engine implementation against best-practice guidance and documented current behavior, evidence paths, and gaps.
- Files changed: scholar/outputs/reports/tutor_engine_audit_2026-01-12.md, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt, AGENTS.md, CONTINUITY.md
- **Learnings:**
  - Patterns discovered: Tutor Engine logs omit course_id/topic_id/source_lock_active even though the schema supports them; audits should cite both engine logging and DB schema.
  - Gotchas encountered: `notes_context_ids` exists in the Tutor API contract but is not used in retrieval, so Source-Lock context can be partial.
---
## 2026-01-13 - US-041
- What was implemented: Drafted Tutor Engine proposal seed pack with retrieval-first, feedback rubric, and telemetry completeness proposals plus coverage note.
- Files changed: scholar/outputs/promotion_queue/tutor_engine_proposal_seed_2026-01-12.md, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt, AGENTS.md, CONTINUITY.md
- **Learnings:**
  - Patterns discovered: Proposal seeds should translate audit gaps into one-change RFCs with clear guardrails.
  - Gotchas encountered: tutor_turns includes fields not populated by log_tutor_turn; highlight in telemetry proposals.

## 2026-01-13 - US-042
- What was implemented: Added Brain ingest + resume research note with evidence-backed findings, Key Takeaways, and coverage note.
- Files changed: scholar/outputs/research_notebook/brain_ingest_plus_resume_research_2026-01-12.md, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt, AGENTS.md, CONTINUITY.md
- **Learnings:**
  - Patterns discovered: Brain ingest/resume research should tie data-quality and learning-analytics evidence to ingest validation and resume feedback design.
  - Gotchas encountered: Crossref title-only searches can return irrelevant DOIs; confirm with author/title queries.
---
## 2026-01-13 - US-043
- What was implemented: Audited Brain ingest + resume against runtime canon and Master Plan invariants; documented current behavior, evidence paths, gaps, and coverage note.
- Files changed: scholar/outputs/reports/brain_ingest_plus_resume_audit_2026-01-12.md, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt, AGENTS.md, CONTINUITY.md
- **Learnings:**
  - Patterns discovered: `ingest_file` uses checksum tracking in `ingested_files`, but `/api/upload` skips it, so duplicates are possible.
  - Gotchas encountered: Brain log template in `brain/session_logs/` is v9.1 while runtime canon log template is v9.2; audits should call out drift explicitly.
---
## 2026-01-13 - US-044
- What was implemented: Drafted Brain ingest + resume proposal seed pack with three one-change RFCs (upload checksum tracking, template-only log rejection, resume metadata) plus coverage note and citations.
- Files changed: scholar/outputs/promotion_queue/brain_ingest_plus_resume_proposal_seed_2026-01-12.md, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt, AGENTS.md, CONTINUITY.md
- **Learnings:**
  - Patterns discovered: Proposal seed packs should align each change to data-quality/freshness evidence and keep metadata impacts explicit.
  - Gotchas encountered: Template-validation and upload dedupe must stay separate one-change RFCs to avoid scope creep.
---
## 2026-01-14 - US-045
- What was implemented: Authored Scholar Orchestrator research note with evidence-backed best practices and citations.
- Files changed: scholar/outputs/research_notebook/scholar_orchestrator_research_2026-01-12.md, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt, AGENTS.md, CONTINUITY.md
- **Learnings:**
  - Patterns discovered: Scholar orchestrator research should ground loop governance in coordination theory, autonomic control loops, and mixed-initiative guidance with DOI links.
  - Gotchas encountered: Some DOI guesses 404; confirm citations via Crossref before locking references.
---
## 2026-01-14 - US-046
- What was implemented: Audited Scholar Orchestrator implementation against runbook requirements and best-practice research, with evidence paths and coverage note.
- Files changed: scholar/outputs/reports/scholar_orchestrator_audit_2026-01-12.md, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt, AGENTS.md, CONTINUITY.md
- **Learnings:**
  - Patterns discovered: Plan update/proposal seed lanes are defined in manifests but only created when digest save or dashboard helpers run.
  - Gotchas encountered: Orchestrator run logs can skip required runbook sections (plan updates, research-on-questions, coverage formatting), so audits must check compliance explicitly.
---
## 2026-01-14 - US-047
- What was implemented: Drafted Scholar Orchestrator proposal seed pack with plan-update enforcement, question->research gating, and safe_mode alignment proposals, each grounded in audit/research evidence.
- Files changed: scholar/outputs/promotion_queue/scholar_orchestrator_proposal_seed_2026-01-12.md, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt, AGENTS.md, CONTINUITY.md
- **Learnings:**
  - Patterns discovered: Orchestrator governance proposals are strongest when tied directly to coordination/control-loop and mixed-initiative sources plus runbook evidence.
  - Gotchas encountered: safe_mode semantics diverge between README/run_scholar and the health check output, so proposals must call out alignment explicitly.
