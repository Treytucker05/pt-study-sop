# M4: Build (Practice and Transfer)

## Purpose
Practice with increasing difficulty, spacing, and variability. Lock understanding and transfer.

---
## Build Toolkit
- Interleave: mix similar-but-different items once basics are known.
- Space: revisit key items multiple times within and across the session (successive relearning).
- Variability: practice across varied cases/angles/contexts to improve transfer.
- Progressive ladder: guided -> faded -> independent -> interleaved -> spaced reinforcement.
- Retrieval + self-explanation: frequent recall with "why/how" reasoning.
- Feedback: immediate on factual errors; brief delay is OK for reasoning.
- Error reflection: note each miss + correction; use for Wrap/cards.

---
## Level Gating (see `sop/src/frameworks/levels.md`)
- L1 (metaphor) and L2 (10-year-old) are open.
- L2 teach-back is required before L4 clinical detail.

---
## Build Protocol
1) Confirm Seed lock from M3.
2) L2 teach-back (required gate).
3) L3 and L4 detail only after L2 passes.
4) Apply practice ladder: worked -> completion -> independent -> interleaved -> spaced reinforcement.
5) Capture misses for Wrap.

## Anatomy Drawing Integration
If anatomy and requested, provide drawing steps:
- Base shape -> steps -> labels -> function
- Use clock positions/fractions for placement

## Difficulty Progression Tiers

| Tier | Description | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Guided** | Full scaffolding — worked examples, step-by-step prompts | First exposure, low confidence |
| **Faded** | Partial scaffolding — completion problems, hints on request | After initial understanding |
| **Independent** | No scaffolding — full retrieval, self-explanation required | After L2 teach-back passes |
| **Interleaved** | Mixed practice — confusable items shuffled, no blocking by topic | After independent success on individual items |

Progression is upward only within a session. If accuracy drops below 50% at any tier, step back one tier and rebuild before advancing again.

If the learner opted into +1 Difficulty or Full Interleave in M1, start one tier higher than the default for their mode.

---
## Exit Condition
- Learner handles mixed/varied items with accuracy and reasoning
- 2-3 correct spaced recalls on key items
- Ready for Wrap (M6) or next bucket
