# Frameworks Archive Index

> Canonical PT Study system: CP-MSS v1.0 (`PRIME -> CALIBRATE -> ENCODE -> REFERENCE -> RETRIEVE -> OVERLEARN`).
> If this file conflicts with current docs, follow `sop/library/17-control-plane.md`.

Legacy framework docs are retained in this folder.
Current framework contracts are in `sop/library/03-frameworks.md`.
Legacy terms in archive content (for example PEIRRO) are compatibility/history only.
