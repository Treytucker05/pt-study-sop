# Learning Cycle: Control Plane Overlay + PEIRRO Compatibility

The runtime follows an operational control-plane cycle while keeping canonical PEIRRO taxonomy for validators, YAML schemas, and compatibility.

---

## Operational Flow (runtime behavior)

**Pattern:** `CONTROL PLANE -> PRIME -> CALIBRATE -> ENCODE -> REFERENCE -> RETRIEVE -> OVERLEARN -> CONTROL PLANE`

### Stage contracts

| Stage | Contract | Required outputs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CONTROL PLANE (entry) | Select assessment mode, initialize coverage map, set gates | mode + coverage map + gate setup |
| PRIME | Orientation only; no scoring | Spine (<=12 nodes), Unknowns, Predictions, GoalTargets |
| CALIBRATE | 2-5 min, 5-10 items, confidence H/M/L, no grading | CalibrateResults + PrioritySet (top 3 weaknesses) |
| ENCODE | PrioritySet-driven construction | encoded weaknesses + confusable discrimination when required |
| REFERENCE | Build compact study references tied to objectives | OnePageAnchor + QuestionBankSeed + CoverageCheck |
| RETRIEVE | Low-support retrieval + adversarial near-miss + latency tracking | retrieval results + ErrorLog updates |
| OVERLEARN | Retention hardening across sessions | Anki draft + DrillSheet + CrossSessionValidation |
| CONTROL PLANE (exit) | Aggregate errors and adaptation decisions for next run | adaptation overrides + next-run plan |

---

## Canonical PEIRRO Mapping (internal compatibility)

PEIRRO categories remain canonical in taxonomy and validators:

- `prepare` hosts PRIME and CALIBRATE operational methods.
- `encode` and `interrogate` host ENCODE and REFERENCE operational work.
- `retrieve` and `refine` host RETRIEVE operational work.
- `overlearn` hosts OVERLEARN operational work.

This preserves:
- method YAML schema validation,
- chain schema validation,
- existing DB seed and runtime assumptions.

---

## KWIK Micro-Loop (unchanged)

KWIK remains inside ENCODE:

`Sound -> Function -> Image -> Resonance -> Lock`

Rules:
- Function before image.
- No step skipping.
- Lock must produce an explicit artifact/log entry.

---

## Execution Invariants

- No stage skipping.
- PRIME and CALIBRATE are always distinct.
- CALIBRATE is diagnostic calibration, not grading.
- Confusable content requires explicit discrimination methods.
- Retrieval-like work must update `ErrorLog.csv`.
- If a step did not happen, output `NOT DONE` / `UNKNOWN` / `NONE` (No Phantom Outputs).

# Frameworks Reference

Quick-reference cards for all H, M, Y, and L frameworks. For PEIRRO and KWIK, see `02-learning-cycle.md`.

**Global rule (all frameworks):** Mark outputs as UNVERIFIED if no learner-provided source is available (Source-Lock — see `01-core-rules.md`).

## H-Series: Priming and Mapping

Expose structure before memorization. Used mainly during the Prime/Prepare phase.

| ID | Name | Pattern | Use When |
|----|------|---------|----------|
| **H1** | System (default) | System -> Subsystem -> Component -> Element -> Cue | Any complex topic; quick hierarchy |
| **H2** | Anatomy | Structure -> Function -> Behavior -> Outcome | Opt-in only; traditional anatomy order |
| **H3** | Load Stack | Intrinsic -> Extraneous -> Germane | Diagnosing overwhelm; reducing load |
| **H4** | Bloom's Depth | Remember -> Understand -> Apply -> Analyze (-> Evaluate -> Create) | Checking target depth; gating detail |
| **H5** | ICAP Engagement | Passive -> Active -> Constructive -> Interactive | Auditing engagement; pushing up |
| **H6** | Bruner Modes | Enactive -> Iconic -> Symbolic | Unsticking concepts; action → image → words |
| **H7** | Narrative | Hook -> Context -> Conflict -> Resolution | Writing statements/cases; summaries |
| **H8** | Prompt Frame | Role -> Task -> Context -> Constraint | Structuring AI prompts/requests |

### H1 Worked Example (Shoulder Complex)

- System: Shoulder Complex
  - Joints: GH, AC, SC, Scapulothoracic
  - Bones: Humerus, Scapula, Clavicle
  - Muscles: Rotator cuff (SITS), Deltoid, Scapular stabilizers
  - Ligaments: GH ligaments, Coracoclavicular

### H-Series Rules

- Default to H1 unless another is explicitly requested.
- Keep scans concise: <=6 bullets or 2 short paragraphs.
- After scan, bucket into 2-4 groups before encoding.

**Bucket menus:** Spatial, Mechanism, Compare/Contrast, Workflow, Timeline.

## M-Series: Encoding and Logic

Convert information into understanding using function-first logic. Used during Encode and Build phases.

### Core Frameworks

| ID | Name | Pattern | Use When |
|----|------|---------|----------|
| **M2** | Trigger (default) | Trigger -> Mechanism -> Result -> Implication | Process or sequence |
| **M6** | Homeostasis | Perturbation -> Correction -> Baseline | Regulation or feedback loops |
| **M8** | Diagnosis | Cause -> Mechanism -> Sign -> Test -> Confirmation | Pathology or clinical reasoning |

### Meta / Design Frameworks

| ID | Name | Pattern | Use When |
|----|------|---------|----------|
| **M-SRL** | Self-Regulated Learning (Zimmerman) | Forethought -> Performance -> Reflection | Study-session control |
| **M-ADDIE** | Instructional Design | Analyze -> Design -> Develop -> Implement -> Evaluate | Project or design work |
| **M-STAR** | Achievement | Situation -> Task -> Action -> Result | Resume or interview prep |

### M-Series Rules

- Default to M2 unless another clearly fits better.
- Function before structure.
- Keep outputs concise: <=6 bullets or 2 short paragraphs unless asked otherwise.

---

## Y-Series: Quick Context

Rapid orientation lenses when H/M frameworks are insufficient. Keep to <=4 bullets.

| ID | Name | Pattern | Use When |
|----|------|---------|----------|
| **Y1** | Generalist | What is it -> What does it do -> How does it fail -> What that looks like | Fast orientation to a new term |
| **Y2** | Load/Stress | Load -> Response -> Threshold -> Outcome | Tissue adaptation, exercise progression, stress testing |
| **Y3** | Compensate | Deficit -> Compensation -> Side Effect | Movement patterns, chronic injuries, workaround behaviors |
| **Y4** | Signal | Signal -> Detection -> Processing -> Action | Neuro/physiology, sensory systems, signaling pathways |

### Y-Series Rules

- Keep to <=4 bullets per Y-series response.

---

## Levels: Pedagogical Depth (L1-L4)

Control explanation depth. Gate advancement with demonstrated comprehension.

| Level | Name | Target | Characteristics |
|-------|------|--------|-----------------|
| **L1** | Metaphor/Analogy | Raw relatable image | No technical terms; everyday comparison; "It's like a..." |
| **L2** | Simple (10-year-old) | Clear child-friendly explanation | Short sentences; everyday words; core concept only; no jargon |
| **L3** | High School | Add terminology and mechanisms | Proper terms; basic mechanism; real-world context |
| **L4** | Professional/Clinical (PT) | Full precision for clinical application | Domain jargon; edge cases; clinical implications |

### Gating Rules

- L1 and L2 are always available.
- L3 requires demonstrated L2 understanding.
- L4 requires a clear L2 teach-back first.
- If learner jumps to L4 terms: stop and request L2 explanation.

**Pattern:** Understand simply -> Add complexity. NOT: Hear complexity -> Hope to understand.

### Practice Modes

- **Core mode:** L1 metaphor -> L2 teach-back -> L4 precision.
- **Sprint mode:** Quick L2 check even when answer is correct.
