- Date:
- Topic:
- Mode:
- Duration (min):

**Anchors Locked:**
-

## 3. Exit Ticket (Final 10 Minutes)

- [ ] **Blurt** (2 min, notes closed) — free recall summary: _______________
- [ ] **Muddiest point** — one concept: _______________
- [ ] **Next action hook** — first action next session: _______________

**Wrap outputs (required):**
- [ ] Spaced retrieval schedule (1-3-7-21 + red/yellow/green adjustment)
- [ ] Tracker JSON per logging schema v9.3
- [ ] Enhanced JSON per logging schema v9.3

**Evidence nuance:**
- Spacing is a heuristic; adjust based on performance.
- Zeigarnik is not used as a memory guarantee; next-action hook is a friction reducer.

**JSON rules:**
- Valid JSON only.
- Semicolon-separated list fields.
- No multiline strings.

## 6. Retrospective Timetable (1-3-7-21)

**Status:** Red = struggled (review sooner) | Yellow = effortful success (keep spacing) | Green = easy (extend interval)

| Item | +1d | Status | +3d | Status | +7d | Status | +21d | Status | Notes |
|------|-----|--------|-----|--------|-----|--------|------|--------|-------|
| [Concept] | YYYY-MM-DD | R/Y/G | YYYY-MM-DD | R/Y/G | YYYY-MM-DD | R/Y/G | YYYY-MM-DD | R/Y/G | |

**CSV variant:**
```
Item,Review1,Status1,Review2,Status2,Review3,Status3,Review4,Status4,Notes
[Concept],YYYY-MM-DD,R/Y/G,YYYY-MM-DD,R/Y/G,YYYY-MM-DD,R/Y/G,YYYY-MM-DD,R/Y/G,[notes]
```

## 7. Progress Tracker

**Status legend:**
- **Not started:** No active session yet
- **In progress:** Learned once but retrieval is weak
- **Needs review:** Learned but failed recent retrieval
- **Solid:** Successful retrieval on two separate sessions

| Module | Topic / LO | Status | Last Date | Next Action | Next Review | Source-Lock | Notes |
|--------|-----------|--------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| M3 | LO 2.1: Shoulder stabilizers | In progress | YYYY-MM-DD | Drill rotator cuff actions | YYYY-MM-DD | Slides 12-18 | Missed supraspinatus action |

**Update cadence:** Update during Wrap. Use exit ticket to set "Next action." Set review dates using 1-3-7-21 default.

## 8. Post-Lecture Elaboration Prompts

Use within 24 hours. Answer from memory first, then check sources.

**Why/How:**
- Why does this step happen first?
- How does this structure create the observed outcome?
- What would change if one component failed?

**Compare/Contrast:**
- How is A different from B?
- Where do they overlap and diverge?

**Predict/Apply:**
- If X increases/decreases, what happens to Y?
- Given a new case, how would the mechanism change?

**Teach-Back:**
- Explain the concept in 3 sentences.
- Explain it to a 10-year-old (L2).

**Error Check:**
- What did I get wrong in the session?
- What is the corrected version?
