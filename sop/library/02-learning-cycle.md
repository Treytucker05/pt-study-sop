# Learning Cycle: PEIRRO + KWIK

Two interlocking loops drive all learning in this SOP. PEIRRO is the macro cycle (session-level). KWIK is the micro-loop (encoding-level) that nests inside PEIRRO's Encode phase.

## PEIRRO — Macro Learning Cycle

**What:** Six-phase cycle that structures every full study session from orientation through long-term retention.

**Pattern:** Prepare -> Encode -> Interrogate -> Retrieve -> Refine -> Overlearn

### Steps

| Phase | Action | Key Rule |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **1. Prepare** | Clarify scope, relevance, and expectations before learning begins | Orient attention first — never dive straight into content |
| **2. Encode** | Actively build durable schemas by linking new material to prior knowledge using multimodal cues (imagery + meaning) | KWIK activates here for memory hooks |
| **3. Interrogate** | Question and explain "why/how" to deepen understanding | Self-explanation, not passive review |
| **4. Retrieve** | Effortful recall without cues | No new information introduced — pure recall |
| **5. Refine** | Correct errors and misconceptions using retrieval feedback | Address gaps before moving on |
| **6. Overlearn** | Continued spaced recall beyond initial mastery | Stabilizes knowledge for long-term retention |

### Execution Rules

- Use PEIRRO as the core learning cycle for all sessions.
- Do not skip phases when running full sessions.
- Phases are sequential — each depends on the prior phase's output.

## KWIK — Encoding Micro-Loop

**What:** Five-step gated process that creates memory hooks by anchoring a phonetic cue to function, then imagery, then a locked artifact.

**Pattern:** Sound -> Function -> Image -> Resonance -> Lock

### Steps

| Step | Action | Gate Condition |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **1. Sound** | Capture a phonetic seed or sound-alike hook | Hook identified before proceeding |
| **2. Function** | State the true function/action of the term | Word + meaning paired before imagery |
| **3. Image** | Build imagery tied directly to the confirmed function | Image anchored to function, not just sound |
| **4. Resonance** | Confirm the hook "sounds right" and "feels right" | Learner approval required — never skip |
| **5. Lock** | Record the hook as a card or log entry | Artifact logged before moving on |

### When KWIK Activates

- During PEIRRO Phase 2 (Encode) when turning mapped buckets into memory hooks.
- For complex or new terms needing a sound-alike hook before meaning.
- Whenever a Seed-Lock or card must be gated through resonance.

### Execution Rules

- Must pair word + meaning before imagery (Function before Image).
- Must gate each step — no skipping ahead.
- Must log a lock (card/hook) before exiting Lock.
- Never skip resonance confirmation.
- Never advance without learner approval for the current step.

### Evidence Signals

- **Helping:** Fast recall with correct meaning; imagery triggers function.
- **Hurting:** Image recalled but meaning forgotten; confusion between similar items.

## How They Connect

```
PEIRRO Session
  1. Prepare
  2. Encode ──> KWIK (Sound -> Function -> Image -> Resonance -> Lock)
  3. Interrogate
  4. Retrieve
  5. Refine
  6. Overlearn
```

KWIK is not a standalone process — it always runs inside PEIRRO's Encode phase. Every other PEIRRO phase operates independently of KWIK.
