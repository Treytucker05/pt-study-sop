description: Interleave questions from 2-3 different topics in a single retrieval block. Builds discrimination and prevents blocked-practice illusion. Based on interleaving research (Rohrer et al.).

  - mixed
  - evidence-based
mechanisms:
  - retrieval
  - interleaving
  - discrimination
  - transfer
inputs:
  - 2-3 different topics for interleaving
  - Question bank or Tutor AI covering all topics
  - Timer (10 min recommended)
  - Randomization method (shuffle cards, AI random selection)
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Select 2-3 distinct but related topics for the session
    notes: Best with topics that could be confused (e.g., similar muscle actions)
  - step: 2
    action: Create or request a mixed question set
    notes: Questions should be randomly ordered, not blocked by topic
  - step: 3
    action: Answer each question, noting which topic it belongs to
    notes: The discrimination ("which topic is this?") is part of the learning
  - step: 4
    action: After answering, verify correctness AND topic classification
    notes: Both content and categorization matter
  - step: 5
    action: Track accuracy by topic separately
    notes: Identifies which topic needs more work
  - step: 6
    action: Reflect on discrimination patterns — which topics did you confuse?
    notes: Confusion patterns reveal conceptual boundaries to strengthen
outputs:
  - Overall accuracy across all topics
  - Per-topic accuracy breakdown
  - Confusion matrix (which topics got mixed up)
  - Discrimination insights (what cues distinguish topics)
stop_criteria:
  - Timer ends (10 min)
  - All questions in the mixed set answered
  - Discrimination accuracy meets threshold (can correctly identify topic)
failure_modes:
  - mode: Blocked practice creeping in (doing all topic A, then all topic B)
    mitigation: Enforce randomization — shuffle before starting
  - mode: Not tracking which topic each question belongs to
    mitigation: Label each question with its topic before answering
  - mode: Frustration at harder recall (interleaving feels harder)
    mitigation: Remind that difficulty is the point — harder now, easier later

facilitation_prompt: |
  You are running M-RET-004 (Mixed Practice) in RETRIEVE stage.
  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.

  Stage hard rules:
  - Require learner attempt first.
  - Do not reveal full answer before attempt.
  - Capture errors and route signals.

  Required outputs:
  - Overall accuracy across all topics
  - Per-topic accuracy breakdown
  - Confusion matrix (which topics got mixed up)
  - Discrimination insights (what cues distinguish topics)

  Stop conditions:
  - Timer ends (10 min)
  - All questions in the mixed set answered
  - Discrimination accuracy meets threshold (can correctly identify topic)

  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.
