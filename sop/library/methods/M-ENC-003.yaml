description: Sketch the structure (anatomy, pathway, concept map) and label from memory. Fill gaps with source material.
default_duration_min: 10
energy_cost: high
best_stage: first_exposure
status: validated
tags:
  - visual
  - anatomy
  - drawing
  - active
  - retrieval
mechanisms:
  - dual_coding
  - retrieval
  - generation
inputs:
  - Structure to draw (anatomy, pathway, diagram)
  - Blank paper or drawing surface
  - Source material for gap-filling
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Close or cover source material
    notes: Drawing from memory is the key mechanism
  - step: 2
    action: Sketch the basic structure/outline from memory
    notes: Rough is fine — focus on spatial relationships
  - step: 3
    action: Label as many parts as you can recall
    notes: Leave blank where uncertain
  - step: 4
    action: Check source material for gaps
    notes: Note which labels you missed
  - step: 5
    action: Fill in missing labels with a different color
    notes: Different color highlights gaps for review
  - step: 6
    action: Redraw from memory if >30% gaps
    notes: Repeat until <30% gaps
outputs:
  - Completed labeled diagram
  - Gap list (what was missing)
  - Accuracy percentage
stop_criteria:
  - Diagram complete with all labels
  - Gap rate <30%
  - 10 minutes elapsed (or earlier if complete)
failure_modes:
  - mode: Looking at source while drawing
    mitigation: Physically cover source material
  - mode: Focusing on artistic quality
    mitigation: Emphasize accuracy over beauty; stick figures acceptable
  - mode: Not tracking gaps
    mitigation: Require different-color pen for filled gaps
logging_fields:
