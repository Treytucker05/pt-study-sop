inputs:
- Structure to draw (anatomy, pathway, diagram)
- Blank paper or drawing surface
- Source material for gap-filling
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Close or cover source material
  notes: Drawing from memory is the key mechanism
- step: 2
  action: Sketch the basic structure/outline from memory
  notes: Rough is fine — focus on spatial relationships
- step: 3
  action: Label as many parts as you can recall
  notes: Leave blank where uncertain
- step: 4
  action: Check source material for gaps
  notes: Note which labels you missed
- step: 5
  action: Fill in missing labels with a different color
  notes: Different color highlights gaps for review
- step: 6
  action: Redraw from memory if >30% gaps
  notes: Repeat until <30% gaps
outputs:
- Completed labeled diagram
- Gap list (what was missing)
- Accuracy percentage
stop_criteria:
- Diagram complete with all labels
- Gap rate <30%
- 10 minutes elapsed (or earlier if complete)
failure_modes:
- mode: Looking at source while drawing
  mitigation: Physically cover source material
- mode: Focusing on artistic quality
  mitigation: Emphasize accuracy over beauty; stick figures acceptable
- mode: Not tracking gaps
  mitigation: Require different-color pen for filled gaps
logging_fields:
- structure_drawn
- labels_recalled
- labels_missed
- gap_percentage
- redraw_count

facilitation_prompt: 'You are running M-ENC-003 (Draw-Label) in ENCODE stage.

  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.


  Stage hard rules:

  - Force active learner processing.

  - Prefer transformation over passive lecture.

  - Keep focus on target concept scope.


  Required outputs:

  - Completed labeled diagram

  - Gap list (what was missing)

  - Accuracy percentage


  Stop conditions:

  - Diagram complete with all labels

  - Gap rate <30%

  - 10 minutes elapsed (or earlier if complete)


  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.

  '
gating_rules:
- Force active processing (explain, transform, or map), not passive reading.
- Keep output scoped to mapped objectives only.
