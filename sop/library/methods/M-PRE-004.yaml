description: Have Tutor generate a topic skeleton with main headings and subheadings. Review for 2-3 min to build mental map.
default_duration_min: 5

mechanisms:

inputs:
  - Topic name
  - Source materials (uploaded to Tutor)
  - Request for skeleton generation
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: "Ask Tutor: 'Generate a skeleton outline for [topic] with main headings and 2-3 subheadings each'"
    notes: Tutor uses Source-Lock to ensure accuracy
  - step: 2
    action: Review the skeleton for 2-3 minutes
    notes: Don't try to memorize — just get the shape
  - step: 3
    action: Identify the 3 most important sections
    notes: These become priority targets for encoding
  - step: 4
    action: Note any unfamiliar terms in headings
    notes: These need definition before deep study
  - step: 5
    action: Keep skeleton visible during study as navigation aid
    notes: Check off sections as you complete them
outputs:
  - Topic skeleton (hierarchical outline)
  - Priority sections identified (top 3)
  - Unfamiliar term list
stop_criteria:
  - Skeleton reviewed
  - Priority sections marked
  - 5 minutes elapsed
failure_modes:
  - mode: Skeleton too detailed
    mitigation: Request 2 levels only (headings + subheadings)
  - mode: Trying to memorize the skeleton
    mitigation: Goal is orientation, not retention
  - mode: Skeleton contains errors
    mitigation: Cross-check against source materials; flag discrepancies
