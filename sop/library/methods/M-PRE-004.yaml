tags:
- advance-organizer
- hierarchy
- top-down
mechanisms:
- schema_activation
- subsumption
stipulations:
- Keep abstraction high; do not include leaf-level memorization details.
- Start from most inclusive concept, then descend one level only.
- PRIME boundary applies: no scoring and no quiz behavior.
when_to_use:
- New, dense, or mechanism-heavy topics.
- Learners who prefer big-picture-first orientation.
when_not_to_use:
- Learner already demonstrates expert-level schema familiarity.
- Ultra-familiar topics where organizer adds redundancy.

  complexity_level: intermediate_outline
  representation_format: markdown_tree
constraints:
  non_assessment: true
  pillar_min: 3
  pillar_max: 5
  max_depth: 2
inputs:
- Topic title
- Learning objectives (preferred)
- Prior mastered topics (optional)
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Identify the most inclusive parent concept
  notes: One sentence maximum.
- step: 2
  action: Extract 3-5 pillar concepts
  notes: Pillars should subsume upcoming details.
- step: 3
  action: Add one sub-branch per pillar
  notes: Keep depth <=2 and omit leaf trivia.
- step: 4
  action: Add one comparative link to prior knowledge for each pillar
  notes: Use concise bridge statements.
outputs:
- PillarTree
- PriorKnowledgeLinks
- StructuralHypotheses
stop_criteria:
- Pillar count between 3 and 5
- Depth <=2
- Every pillar has at least one prior-knowledge bridge
failure_modes:
- mode: Tree becomes detail-heavy
  mitigation: Collapse leaf nodes to pillar/sub-branch only.
- mode: No prior bridge links
  mitigation: Force one bridge sentence per pillar.
logging_fields:
- pillar_count
- depth_level
- bridge_link_count

facilitation_prompt: 'You are running M-PRE-004 (Hierarchical Advance Organizer) in PRIME stage.

  This method is non-assessment.

  Build a top-down organizer, not a lesson and not a quiz.


  Requirements:

  - 3-5 pillars, max depth 2.

  - One concise prior-knowledge bridge per pillar.

  - Output in {representation_format} at {complexity_level}.

  - No scoring, no checks, no retrieval prompts.


  Return exactly:

  1) PillarTree

  2) PriorKnowledgeLinks

  3) StructuralHypotheses

  '
gating_rules:
- Do not assess or score the learner in PRIME.
- Stay at orientation level and avoid full solution reveal.
