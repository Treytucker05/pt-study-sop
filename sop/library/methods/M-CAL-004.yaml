category: prepare
description: 'After receiving the big-picture narrative overview, rate your confidence in the story as a whole. Can you retell the narrative thread? Where does the story break down? Light-touch calibration that respects top-down learners — no item-level quizzing.'
default_duration_min: 2
energy_cost: low
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: CALIBRATE
status: active
tags:
- calibrate
- confidence
- narrative
- top-down
- metacognition
mechanisms:
- metacognitive_monitoring
- calibration
- schema_assessment
stipulations:
- Must happen AFTER the learner has received a narrative overview, not before
- No item-level questions — this is story-level confidence only
- Confidence captured before any corrective feedback
- Respects the top-down flow — does not break narrative immersion
when_to_use:
- After a narrative PRIME or L1-L2 encoding build
- When learner prefers top-down big-picture processing
- Before deciding depth of encoding needed
when_not_to_use:
- After item-level pretest (use M-CAL-002 instead)
- When material has no narrative structure
knobs:
  confidence_scale:
    type: enum
    options:
    - three_point
    - five_point
    default: three_point
  probe_depth:
    type: enum
    options:
    - surface
    - structural
    default: surface
constraints:
  non_assessment: true
  narrative_level_only: true
  no_item_quizzing: true
inputs:
- Completed narrative overview from PRIME or early ENCODE
- The story thread the learner just received
steps:
- step: 1
  action: 'Ask: "Can you see the whole story in your head? Rate 1-3: (1) fuzzy, (2) partial, (3) clear"'
  notes: 'Quick gut check — no overthinking'
- step: 2
  action: 'Ask: "Where does the story break down or get fuzzy?"'
  notes: 'Identify the weakest part of the narrative thread'
- step: 3
  action: 'Tag fuzzy areas as priority targets for deeper encoding'
  notes: 'These become the focus areas for ENCODE phase'
outputs:
- Story confidence rating (1-3)
- Fuzzy zones list (narrative breakdown points)
- Priority encoding targets
stop_criteria:
- Confidence rating captured
- At least one fuzzy zone identified (or explicit "none — it all clicks")
- Takes less than 2 minutes
failure_modes:
- mode: Learner says they got it all when they did not
  mitigation: Ask them to retell the story arc in 2 sentences. If they cannot, recalibrate.
- mode: Turns into a quiz
  mitigation: 'Stop. This is story-level confidence only, not item testing'
- mode: Takes too long
  mitigation: 'Hard cap at 2 minutes. Quick gut check, not deep analysis'
logging_fields:
- story_confidence_rating
- fuzzy_zone_count

  You are running M-CAL-004 (Story Confidence Tag) in CALIBRATE stage.
  Capture narrative-level confidence after the big-picture overview.

  Requirements:
  - Ask learner to rate story confidence on {confidence_scale} scale.
  - Ask where the narrative breaks down or gets fuzzy.
  - Tag fuzzy areas as priority targets for deeper encoding.
  - No item-level questions — story-level confidence only.
  - Hard cap at 2 minutes.

  Return exactly:
  1) StoryConfidenceRating
  2) FuzzyZonesList (narrative breakdown points)
  3) PriorityEncodingTargets

  Do not teach or explain content. This method is diagnostic only.
