category: overlearn
description: 'Close all materials. Write everything you remember from the session — stories, connections, details, anything. Then open materials, compare, identify gaps, and fill them in. Different from Free Recall Blurt: this is comprehensive session-level closure, not topic-level retrieval practice.'

tags:
- recall
- brain-dump
- metacognition

- closure
- session-wrap
mechanisms:
- retrieval
- generation
- metacognition
- consolidation
- error_detection
stipulations:
- All materials must be closed during the dump phase
- Dump is comprehensive (whole session), not focused on one topic
- Gap-fill phase is targeted — only fill identified gaps, don't re-study everything
- Time-capped at 7 minutes total (5 dump + 2 gap-fill)
when_to_use:
- End of any learning session as closure activity
- After encoding + retrieval blocks to consolidate
- When learner wants metacognitive summary of what stuck vs. what didn't
when_not_to_use:
- Very short sessions (<15 min) where Exit Ticket suffices
- Pure drill/speed sessions where Exit Ticket is better fit

constraints:
  closed_note_first: true
  time_cap_minutes: 7
  dump_before_review: true
inputs:
- Completed study session (all blocks done)
- Blank paper or text area
- Timer (5 min dump + 2 min gap-fill)
- Session materials (closed during dump, opened for gap-fill)
steps:
- step: 1
  action: 'Close ALL materials — notes, slides, textbook, everything'
  notes: 'Materials must be completely out of sight'
- step: 2
  action: 'Set timer for 5 minutes. Write everything you remember from this session'
  notes: 'Stream of consciousness. Stories, facts, connections, pictures, analogies — anything that comes to mind'
- step: 3
  action: 'When stuck, write "?" and keep going'
  notes: 'Gaps are data, not failures. Mark them and move on'
- step: 4
  action: 'Timer ends. Open materials and compare your dump to the session content'
  notes: 'Spend max 2 minutes on this comparison'
- step: 5
  action: 'Identify gaps — what did you miss? What was wrong?'
  notes: 'Circle or highlight missing items. These are priority review targets'
- step: 6
  action: 'Fill gaps with brief annotations (not full re-study)'
  notes: 'One-line corrections or additions only. This is gap-fill, not re-learning'
outputs:
- Brain dump text (raw recall)
- Gap list (what was missing or wrong)
- Gap-fill annotations
- Session retention estimate (percentage of material recalled)
stop_criteria:
- 7-minute total timer ends (hard stop)
- Dump phase complete + gap comparison done
- At least one gap identified and annotated
failure_modes:
- mode: Peeking during dump phase
  mitigation: 'Physically remove materials from workspace before starting'
- mode: Spending too long on gap-fill (turning into re-study)
  mitigation: '2-minute hard cap on gap-fill. One-line annotations only'
- mode: Writing nothing because "I forgot everything"
  mitigation: 'Start with any single fact or story fragment. Memory cascades from there'
- mode: Skipping the gap comparison
  mitigation: Gap comparison is mandatory. It reveals what did not encode.

  You are running M-OVR-004 (Post-Learn Brain Dump) in OVERLEARN stage.
  Guide the learner through comprehensive session-level free recall and gap-fill.

  Requirements:
  - Ensure ALL materials are closed before dump phase begins.
  - Set timer for 5 minutes. Learner writes everything remembered ({dump_format}).
  - When stuck, write "?" and keep going — gaps are data, not failures.
  - After 5 min, open materials and compare (max 2 min).
  - Identify gaps — what was missed or wrong?
  - Fill gaps with one-line annotations only ({gap_fill_mode}).

  Return exactly:
  1) DumpWordCount
  2) GapCount (items missed or wrong)
  3) GapFillAnnotations
  4) RetentionEstimate (percentage of session material recalled)

  This builds recall fluency at the session level — comprehensive, not item-by-item.
  Hard stop at {time_cap_minutes} minutes total. This is closure, not re-learning.
