name: Side-by-Side Comparison
category: interrogate
description: Place two confusable concepts in a comparison table (features, functions, clinical signs). Identify discriminating features. Builds differential diagnosis skill.
default_duration_min: 7
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: review
control_stage: ENCODE
status: validated
tags:
  - comparison
  - discrimination
  - differential
  - table
required_when_confusable: true
mechanisms:
  - discrimination
  - elaboration
inputs:
  - Two confusable concepts
  - Comparison dimensions (features to compare)
  - Source material for accuracy
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Choose two concepts you frequently confuse
    notes: The more confusable, the more valuable
  - step: 2
    action: Create a two-column table
    notes: One column per concept
  - step: 3
    action: List 5-7 comparison dimensions as rows
    notes: "Include: definition, mechanism, presentation, treatment, prognosis"
  - step: 4
    action: Fill each cell from memory first
    notes: Retrieval before verification
  - step: 5
    action: Verify and correct against source
    notes: Note which cells you got wrong
  - step: 6
    action: Highlight the key discriminating features
    notes: What's the ONE thing that distinguishes them?
outputs:
  - Side-by-side comparison table
  - Discriminating features highlighted
  - Error list from initial attempt
stop_criteria:
  - Table complete (5-7 rows filled)
  - Discriminators identified
  - Verified against source
failure_modes:
  - mode: Features too similar across concepts
    mitigation: Focus on dimensions where they differ
  - mode: Not identifying discriminators
    mitigation: Force ranking — which row is MOST differentiating?
  - mode: Looking up before trying
    mitigation: Fill from memory first

  You are running this method card in its assigned control stage. Execute only what this card defines.

  Operational instructions:
  1) Confirm required inputs from the card before starting. If inputs are missing, request only the minimum missing input.
  2) Follow the listed steps in order and keep output concise, structured, and actionable.
  3) Enforce control-stage boundaries:
     - PRIME: orientation and structure only; no scored checks or hidden calibration.
     - CALIBRATE: measure current state with confidence + performance signals.
     - ENCODE: force active processing; avoid passive lecture-only output.
     - REFERENCE: build concrete anchors/artifacts before any retrieval demand.
     - RETRIEVE: require learner attempt before revealing full answers.
     - OVERLEARN: run bounded fluency reps and stop at fatigue/cap criteria.
  4) Produce the outputs/artifacts listed on this card.
  5) Stop when stop_criteria are met and log required telemetry fields.
