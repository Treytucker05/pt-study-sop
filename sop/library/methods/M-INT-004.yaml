inputs:
- Two confusable concepts
- Comparison dimensions (features to compare)
- Source material for accuracy
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Choose two concepts you frequently confuse
  notes: The more confusable, the more valuable
- step: 2
  action: Create a two-column table
  notes: One column per concept
- step: 3
  action: List 5-7 comparison dimensions as rows
  notes: 'Include: definition, mechanism, presentation, treatment, prognosis'
- step: 4
  action: Fill each cell from memory first
  notes: Retrieval before verification
- step: 5
  action: Verify and correct against source
  notes: Note which cells you got wrong
- step: 6
  action: Highlight the key discriminating features
  notes: What's the ONE thing that distinguishes them?
outputs:
- Side-by-side comparison table
- Discriminating features highlighted
- Error list from initial attempt
stop_criteria:
- Table complete (5-7 rows filled)
- Discriminators identified
- Verified against source
failure_modes:
- mode: Features too similar across concepts
  mitigation: Focus on dimensions where they differ
- mode: Not identifying discriminators
  mitigation: Force ranking — which row is MOST differentiating?
- mode: Looking up before trying
  mitigation: Fill from memory first

facilitation_prompt: 'You are running M-INT-004 (Side-by-Side Comparison) in ENCODE stage.

  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.


  Stage hard rules:

  - Force active learner processing.

  - Prefer transformation over passive lecture.

  - Keep focus on target concept scope.


  Required outputs:

  - Side-by-side comparison table

  - Discriminating features highlighted

  - Error list from initial attempt


  Stop conditions:

  - Table complete (5-7 rows filled)

  - Discriminators identified

  - Verified against source


  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.

  '
gating_rules:
- Force active processing (explain, transform, or map), not passive reading.
- Keep output scoped to mapped objectives only.
