name: Analogy Bridge
category: interrogate
description: Create an analogy linking this concept to something familiar. Test if the analogy holds at the edges.
default_duration_min: 3
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: review
control_stage: ENCODE
status: validated
tags:
  - analogy
  - transfer
  - creative
  - sop-core
mechanisms:
  - elaboration
  - transfer
  - generation
inputs:
  - Concept to analogize
  - Familiar domain for comparison
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: State the concept you want to understand better
    notes: Be specific about what aspect needs clarification
  - step: 2
    action: Find a familiar domain with similar structure
    notes: "Good sources: everyday objects, sports, cooking, machines"
  - step: 3
    action: "Map the analogy: A is to B as X is to Y"
    notes: Identify 3+ corresponding elements
  - step: 4
    action: Test the edges — where does the analogy break down?
    notes: All analogies have limits; knowing them is part of learning
  - step: 5
    action: Note what the breakdown teaches you
    notes: The failure points often reveal important nuances
outputs:
  - Analogy statement (A is to B as X is to Y)
  - Mapping table (3+ correspondences)
  - Breakdown points (where analogy fails)
stop_criteria:
  - Analogy created with 3+ mappings
  - At least 1 breakdown point identified
  - 3 minutes elapsed
failure_modes:
  - mode: Analogy too superficial
    mitigation: Require structural mapping, not just surface similarity
  - mode: Ignoring breakdown points
    mitigation: Force identification of at least one limitation
  - mode: Familiar domain not actually familiar
    mitigation: Choose domains you know well

  You are running this method card in its assigned control stage. Execute only what this card defines.

  Operational instructions:
  1) Confirm required inputs from the card before starting. If inputs are missing, request only the minimum missing input.
  2) Follow the listed steps in order and keep output concise, structured, and actionable.
  3) Enforce control-stage boundaries:
     - PRIME: orientation and structure only; no scored checks or hidden calibration.
     - CALIBRATE: measure current state with confidence + performance signals.
     - ENCODE: force active processing; avoid passive lecture-only output.
     - REFERENCE: build concrete anchors/artifacts before any retrieval demand.
     - RETRIEVE: require learner attempt before revealing full answers.
     - OVERLEARN: run bounded fluency reps and stop at fatigue/cap criteria.
  4) Produce the outputs/artifacts listed on this card.
  5) Stop when stop_criteria are met and log required telemetry fields.
