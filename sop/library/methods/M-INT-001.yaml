inputs:
- Concept to analogize
- Familiar domain for comparison
steps:
- step: 1
  action: State the concept you want to understand better
  notes: Be specific about what aspect needs clarification
- step: 2
  action: Find a familiar domain with similar structure
  notes: 'Good sources: everyday objects, sports, cooking, machines'
- step: 3
  action: 'Map the analogy: A is to B as X is to Y'
  notes: Identify 3+ corresponding elements
- step: 4
  action: Test the edges — where does the analogy break down?
  notes: All analogies have limits; knowing them is part of learning
- step: 5
  action: Note what the breakdown teaches you
  notes: The failure points often reveal important nuances
outputs:
- Analogy statement (A is to B as X is to Y)
- Mapping table (3+ correspondences)
- Breakdown points (where analogy fails)
stop_criteria:
- Analogy created with 3+ mappings
- At least 1 breakdown point identified
- 3 minutes elapsed
failure_modes:
- mode: Analogy too superficial
  mitigation: Require structural mapping, not just surface similarity
- mode: Ignoring breakdown points
  mitigation: Force identification of at least one limitation
- mode: Familiar domain not actually familiar
  mitigation: Choose domains you know well

facilitation_prompt: 'You are running M-INT-001 (Analogy Bridge) in ENCODE stage.

  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.


  Stage hard rules:

  - Force active learner processing.

  - Prefer transformation over passive lecture.

  - Keep focus on target concept scope.


  Required outputs:

  - Analogy statement (A is to B as X is to Y)

  - Mapping table (3+ correspondences)

  - Breakdown points (where analogy fails)


  Stop conditions:

  - Analogy created with 3+ mappings

  - At least 1 breakdown point identified

  - 3 minutes elapsed


  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.

  '
gating_rules:
- Force active processing (explain, transform, or map), not passive reading.
- Keep output scoped to mapped objectives only.
