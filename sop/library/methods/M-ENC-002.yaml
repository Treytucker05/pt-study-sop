name: Seed-Lock Generation
category: encode
description: Learner generates their own encoding hook BEFORE the AI offers help.
  Start with your own association, metaphor, or mnemonic. AI only assists if you're
  stuck. Enforces active generation over passive reception.
default_duration_min: 3
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: ENCODE

tags:
- seed-lock
- generation-first
- active
- sop-core
mechanisms:
- generation
- elaboration
- desirable_difficulty
inputs:
- New term or concept to encode
- Definition from source material
- 90-second timer
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Read the term and its definition
  notes: Understand what you're encoding before generating
- step: 2
  action: Set timer for 90 seconds
  notes: Time pressure forces retrieval attempt
- step: 3
  action: Generate your OWN hook — association, metaphor, mnemonic, or image
  notes: This is the "Seed" — your first attempt
- step: 4
  action: Write down your Seed even if imperfect
  notes: Any attempt is better than waiting for AI
- step: 5
  action: If stuck after 90s, ask Tutor for a suggestion
  notes: AI provides only if you've tried first
- step: 6
  action: Lock the final hook (yours or AI-assisted)
  notes: Record for spaced repetition
outputs:
- Learner-generated Seed (primary hook attempt)
- Final locked hook
- Generation success flag (self vs AI-assisted)
stop_criteria:
- Hook generated (self or AI-assisted)
- 90-second attempt completed
- Hook locked for retention
failure_modes:
- mode: Asking AI immediately
  mitigation: Enforce 90-second wait before AI help
- mode: Giving up too fast
  mitigation: Require written attempt even if "bad"
- mode: Over-relying on AI hooks
  mitigation: Track self-generation rate; flag if <50%

knobs:
  cognitive_depth: mechanism
  scaffolding_intensity: heavy_hints
  output_format: markdown_table
facilitation_prompt: You are guiding the student through the encoding phase. The student
  needs to structure their knowledge. Your task is to generate a structured breakdown
  at a mechanism level. Provide scaffolding at the heavy_hints level. Output your
  response as a markdown_table.
