name: Seed-Lock Generation
category: encode
description: Learner generates their own encoding hook BEFORE the AI offers help. Start with your own association, metaphor, or mnemonic. AI only assists if you're stuck. Enforces active generation over passive reception.
default_duration_min: 3
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: ENCODE
status: validated
tags:
  - seed-lock
  - generation-first
  - active
  - sop-core
mechanisms:
  - generation
  - elaboration
  - desirable_difficulty
inputs:
  - New term or concept to encode
  - Definition from source material
  - 90-second timer
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Read the term and its definition
    notes: Understand what you're encoding before generating
  - step: 2
    action: Set timer for 90 seconds
    notes: Time pressure forces retrieval attempt
  - step: 3
    action: Generate your OWN hook — association, metaphor, mnemonic, or image
    notes: This is the "Seed" — your first attempt
  - step: 4
    action: Write down your Seed even if imperfect
    notes: Any attempt is better than waiting for AI
  - step: 5
    action: If stuck after 90s, ask Tutor for a suggestion
    notes: AI provides only if you've tried first
  - step: 6
    action: Lock the final hook (yours or AI-assisted)
    notes: Record for spaced repetition
outputs:
  - Learner-generated Seed (primary hook attempt)
  - Final locked hook
  - Generation success flag (self vs AI-assisted)
stop_criteria:
  - Hook generated (self or AI-assisted)
  - 90-second attempt completed
  - Hook locked for retention
failure_modes:
  - mode: Asking AI immediately
    mitigation: Enforce 90-second wait before AI help
  - mode: Giving up too fast
    mitigation: Require written attempt even if "bad"
  - mode: Over-relying on AI hooks
    mitigation: Track self-generation rate; flag if <50%
logging_fields:

  You are running this method card in its assigned control stage. Execute only what this card defines.

  Operational instructions:
  1) Confirm required inputs from the card before starting. If inputs are missing, request only the minimum missing input.
  2) Follow the listed steps in order and keep output concise, structured, and actionable.
  3) Enforce control-stage boundaries:
     - PRIME: orientation and structure only; no scored checks or hidden calibration.
     - CALIBRATE: measure current state with confidence + performance signals.
     - ENCODE: force active processing; avoid passive lecture-only output.
     - REFERENCE: build concrete anchors/artifacts before any retrieval demand.
     - RETRIEVE: require learner attempt before revealing full answers.
     - OVERLEARN: run bounded fluency reps and stop at fatigue/cap criteria.
  4) Produce the outputs/artifacts listed on this card.
  5) Stop when stop_criteria are met and log required telemetry fields.
