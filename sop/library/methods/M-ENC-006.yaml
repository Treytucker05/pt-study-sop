id: M-ENC-006
name: Think-Aloud Protocol
category: encode
description: Verbalize your reasoning step-by-step while working through a problem or reading. Exposes gaps in logic and strengthens self-explanation. Based on Chi et al. self-explanation research.
default_duration_min: 5
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: review
control_stage: ENCODE
status: validated
tags:
  - self-explanation
  - metacognition
  - verbal
  - evidence-based
mechanisms:
  - elaboration
  - calibration
  - feedback
inputs:
  - Problem or passage to work through
  - Recording device (optional but recommended)
  - Quiet environment for speaking aloud
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Read the first sentence or problem step
    notes: Take one unit at a time
  - step: 2
    action: Verbalize what you understand from it
    notes: "Say: 'This means that...'"
  - step: 3
    action: Explain how it connects to what came before
    notes: "Say: 'This follows because...'"
  - step: 4
    action: Predict what comes next
    notes: "Say: 'So I expect...'"
  - step: 5
    action: Note any confusion points aloud
    notes: "Say: 'I'm confused about...'"
  - step: 6
    action: Move to next unit and repeat
    notes: Continue until passage/problem complete
outputs:
  - Think-aloud recording or notes
  - Confusion points list
  - Connection map (implicit)
stop_criteria:
  - Passage or problem fully processed
  - All confusion points noted
  - 5 minutes elapsed (or content complete)
failure_modes:
  - mode: Silent reading
    mitigation: Must vocalize; silent defeats the purpose
  - mode: Just reading aloud without explaining
    mitigation: Require "This means..." after each unit
  - mode: Skipping confusion points
    mitigation: Pause and note whenever hesitation occurs
logging_fields:
  - content_processed
  - confusion_count
  - prediction_accuracy
  - total_time

evidence_raw: Chi et al. (1994); self-explanation leads to deeper understanding and better problem-solving

  You are running this method card in its assigned control stage. Execute only what this card defines.

  Operational instructions:
  1) Confirm required inputs from the card before starting. If inputs are missing, request only the minimum missing input.
  2) Follow the listed steps in order and keep output concise, structured, and actionable.
  3) Enforce control-stage boundaries:
     - PRIME: orientation and structure only; no scored checks or hidden calibration.
     - CALIBRATE: measure current state with confidence + performance signals.
     - ENCODE: force active processing; avoid passive lecture-only output.
     - REFERENCE: build concrete anchors/artifacts before any retrieval demand.
     - RETRIEVE: require learner attempt before revealing full answers.
     - OVERLEARN: run bounded fluency reps and stop at fatigue/cap criteria.
  4) Produce the outputs/artifacts listed on this card.
  5) Stop when stop_criteria are met and log required telemetry fields.
