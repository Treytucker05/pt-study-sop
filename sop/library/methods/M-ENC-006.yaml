name: Think-Aloud Protocol
category: encode
description: Verbalize your reasoning step-by-step while working through a problem or reading. Exposes gaps in logic and strengthens
  self-explanation. Based on Chi et al. self-explanation research.
default_duration_min: 5
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: review

status: validated

knobs:
  guidance_level: medium
  output_format: bullets
constraints:
  active_processing_required: true
  objective_scope_required: true
  no_final_answer_only: true
inputs:
- Problem or passage to work through
- Recording device (optional but recommended)
- Quiet environment for speaking aloud
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Read the first sentence or problem step
  notes: Take one unit at a time
- step: 2
  action: Verbalize what you understand from it
  notes: 'Say: ''This means that...'''
- step: 3
  action: Explain how it connects to what came before
  notes: 'Say: ''This follows because...'''
- step: 4
  action: Predict what comes next
  notes: 'Say: ''So I expect...'''
- step: 5
  action: Note any confusion points aloud
  notes: 'Say: ''I''m confused about...'''
- step: 6
  action: Move to next unit and repeat
  notes: Continue until passage/problem complete
outputs:
- Think-aloud recording or notes
- Confusion points list
- Connection map (implicit)
stop_criteria:
- Passage or problem fully processed
- All confusion points noted
- 5 minutes elapsed (or content complete)
failure_modes:
- mode: Silent reading
  mitigation: Must vocalize; silent defeats the purpose
- mode: Just reading aloud without explaining
  mitigation: Require "This means..." after each unit
- mode: Skipping confusion points
  mitigation: Pause and note whenever hesitation occurs
logging_fields:
- content_processed
- confusion_count
- prediction_accuracy
- total_time

facilitation_prompt: 'You are running M-ENC-006 (Think-Aloud Protocol) in ENCODE stage.

  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.


  Stage hard rules:

  - Force active learner processing.

  - Prefer transformation over passive lecture.

  - Keep focus on target concept scope.


  Required outputs:

  - Think-aloud recording or notes

  - Confusion points list

  - Connection map (implicit)


  Stop conditions:

  - Passage or problem fully processed

  - All confusion points noted

  - 5 minutes elapsed (or content complete)


  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.

  '
gating_rules:
- Force active processing (explain, transform, or map), not passive reading.
- Keep output scoped to mapped objectives only.
