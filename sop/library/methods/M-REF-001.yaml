description: 'Review errors from retrieval practice. For each error: (1) What did I say? (2) What''s correct? (3) Why did I confuse them? (4) What cue will prevent this next time? Metacognitive error analysis.'
default_duration_min: 5
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: exam_prep
control_stage: REFERENCE
status: validated
tags:
  - error-analysis
  - metacognition
  - correction
  - evidence-based
mechanisms:
  - error_correction
  - metacognition
  - elaboration
  - discrimination
inputs:
  - List of errors from recent retrieval practice
  - Correct answers for each error
  - Reference materials for deep understanding
  - Error autopsy template (4-column format)
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Collect all errors from recent retrieval session
    notes: Use sprint quiz misses, free recall gaps, or exam review errors
  - step: 2
    action: "For each error, write Column 1: 'What did I say?'"
    notes: Record your exact wrong answer — no sanitizing
  - step: 3
    action: "Write Column 2: 'What's correct?'"
    notes: Record the accurate answer with source citation if possible
  - step: 4
    action: "Write Column 3: 'Why did I confuse them?'"
    notes: This is the key insight — identify the conceptual confusion or memory interference
  - step: 5
    action: "Write Column 4: 'What cue will prevent this next time?'"
    notes: Create a discrimination cue or mnemonic to prevent recurrence
  - step: 6
    action: Convert high-value autopsies into Anki cards
    notes: Error-based cards are high-yield for exam prep
outputs:
  - Completed error autopsy table
  - Root cause analysis for each error
  - Discrimination cues created
  - Anki card candidates identified
stop_criteria:
  - All errors from session analyzed
  - Each error has a prevention cue
  - High-value errors converted to study artifacts
failure_modes:
  - mode: Superficial analysis (just noting "I was wrong")
    mitigation: Column 3 (Why confused?) is mandatory — dig into the root cause
  - mode: Skipping the prevention cue (Column 4)
    mitigation: No closure without a specific cue to prevent recurrence
  - mode: Defensive attribution ("trick question", "unfair")
    mitigation: Assume the error reveals something to learn — own it

  You are running M-REF-001 (Error Autopsy) in REFERENCE stage.
  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.

  Stage hard rules:
  - Build concrete anchors and artifacts.
  - Map concept to applied context.
  - Do not skip artifact creation.

  Required outputs:
  - Completed error autopsy table
  - Root cause analysis for each error
  - Discrimination cues created
  - Anki card candidates identified

  Stop conditions:
  - All errors from session analyzed
  - Each error has a prevention cue
  - High-value errors converted to study artifacts

  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.
