category: overlearn
description: Draft 3-5 Anki cards for the session's key concepts. Use cloze or basic format. Brain syncs to Anki.
default_duration_min: 5
energy_cost: low
best_stage: consolidation
status: validated
tags:
  - anki
  - spaced-repetition
  - artifacts
mechanisms:
  - spacing
  - retrieval
  - generation
  - artifact_creation
inputs:
  - Session notes and key concepts
  - Anki card template (cloze or basic)
  - Card draft staging area (Brain or text file)
  - Target deck name
gating_rules:
  - Output ONLY canonical card blocks. No prose before/after cards.
  - Produce 3-5 cards total.
  - Each card must use exact labels and line order:
    CARD N:, TYPE:, FRONT:, BACK:, TAGS:
  - Do not use bullets, markdown tables, CSV, or JSON.
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Review session notes and identify 3-5 highest-value concepts
    notes: Prioritize weak anchors, new vocabulary, and easily confused items
  - step: 2
    action: Choose card format for each concept (cloze vs. basic Q&A)
    notes: Cloze for vocabulary/facts; Basic for "why" questions and processes
  - step: 3
    action: Draft the front of each card (question or cloze deletion)
    notes: One fact per card — no "double-barreled" cards
  - step: 4
    action: Draft the back of each card (answer)
    notes: Keep answers concise — elaboration goes in the "Extra" field
  - step: 5
    action: Add context tags (topic, source, date)
    notes: Tags enable filtered study and tracking
  - step: 6
    action: Stage cards for sync to Anki via Brain
    notes: Brain's Anki integration handles the actual sync
  - step: 7
    action: Final format check before submit
    notes: Verify output contains only CARD blocks and exact label lines
outputs:
  - 3-5 drafted Anki cards
  - Cards tagged by topic and source
  - Cards staged in Brain for Anki sync
  - Card count logged to session record
stop_criteria:
  - 3-5 cards drafted (minimum 3)
  - All cards follow single-fact rule
  - Every card has TYPE, FRONT, BACK, TAGS label lines
  - Cards staged for sync
failure_modes:
  - mode: Double-barreled cards (multiple facts per card)
    mitigation: Split into separate cards — one fact each
  - mode: Cards too complex (essay answers)
    mitigation: If answer takes > 10 seconds to recall, simplify
  - mode: Drafting cards for material not yet understood
    mitigation: Only card concepts you can already explain — cards are for retention, not learning
