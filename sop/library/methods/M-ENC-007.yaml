id: M-ENC-007
name: Self-Explanation Protocol
category: encode
description: After reading each paragraph or concept, pause and explain WHY each step follows from the previous one. Supports silent, spoken, or written verbalization modes. Focus on reasoning, not restating facts. Merges Think-Aloud Protocol (formerly M-ENC-006).

constraints:

inputs:
- Text passage or concept sequence
- Note-taking area (written mode) or quiet environment (spoken mode)
- Timer (optional)
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Read one paragraph or concept unit
  notes: One unit at a time — don't batch
- step: 2
  action: Stop and explain WHY this follows from the previous content
  notes: 'Ask: ''Why does this make sense given what came before?'''
- step: 3
  action: Predict what comes next before reading on
  notes: Prediction forces active engagement and exposes assumptions
- step: 4
  action: Express your explanation in your chosen verbalization mode
  notes: Written forces precision; spoken exposes hesitation; silent is fastest but least accountable
- step: 5
  action: Identify any inference gaps or confusion points
  notes: Where are you assuming knowledge you don't have? Note confusion aloud if in spoken mode
- step: 6
  action: Flag gaps for follow-up
  notes: These become targeted study items
- step: 7
  action: Move to next unit and repeat
  notes: Continue through entire passage
outputs:
- Self-explanation notes or think-aloud log (per paragraph)
- Inference gap list
- Confusion points flagged
- Comprehension checkpoints
stop_criteria:
- All paragraphs processed
- Major gaps and confusion points flagged
- 7 minutes elapsed (or content complete)
failure_modes:
- mode: Just restating facts
  mitigation: Require causal connectors — "because", "therefore", "this leads to"
- mode: Skipping "obvious" sections
  mitigation: Explain everything; "obvious" often means "unexamined"
- mode: Not writing explanations (in written mode)
  mitigation: Written notes required; verbal insufficient for written mode
- mode: Silent reading without explaining (in spoken mode)
  mitigation: Must vocalize; silent defeats the purpose of think-aloud
- mode: Skipping prediction step
  mitigation: Prediction is required — commit before reading ahead

facilitation_prompt: 'You are running M-ENC-007 (Self-Explanation Protocol) in ENCODE stage.

  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.

  Verbalization mode knob: silent / spoken / written (default: written).

  Stage hard rules:

  - Force active learner processing.

  - Prefer transformation over passive lecture.

  - Keep focus on target concept scope.


  Required outputs:

  - Self-explanation notes or think-aloud log (per paragraph)

  - Inference gap list

  - Confusion points flagged

  - Comprehension checkpoints


  Stop conditions:

  - All paragraphs processed

  - Major gaps and confusion points flagged

  - 7 minutes elapsed (or content complete)


  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.

  '
gating_rules:
- Force active processing (explain, transform, or map), not passive reading.
- Keep output scoped to mapped objectives only.
