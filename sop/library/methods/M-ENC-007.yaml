id: M-ENC-007
name: Self-Explanation Protocol
category: encode
description: After reading each paragraph or concept, pause and explain to yourself WHY each step follows from the previous one. Focus on explaining the reasoning, not just restating facts.
default_duration_min: 7
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: ENCODE
status: validated
tags:
  - self-explanation
  - comprehension
  - causal-reasoning
  - evidence-based
mechanisms:
  - elaboration
  - generation
  - calibration
inputs:
  - Text passage or concept sequence
  - Note-taking area
  - Timer (optional)
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Read one paragraph or concept unit
    notes: One unit at a time — don't batch
  - step: 2
    action: Stop and explain WHY this follows from the previous content
    notes: "Ask: 'Why does this make sense given what came before?'"
  - step: 3
    action: Write your explanation in your own words
    notes: Writing forces precision
  - step: 4
    action: Identify any inference gaps
    notes: Where are you assuming knowledge you don't have?
  - step: 5
    action: Flag gaps for follow-up
    notes: These become targeted study items
  - step: 6
    action: Move to next unit and repeat
    notes: Continue through entire passage
outputs:
  - Self-explanation notes (per paragraph)
  - Inference gap list
  - Comprehension checkpoints
stop_criteria:
  - All paragraphs processed
  - Major gaps flagged
  - 7 minutes elapsed (or content complete)
failure_modes:
  - mode: Just restating facts
    mitigation: Require causal connectors — "because", "therefore", "this leads to"
  - mode: Skipping "obvious" sections
    mitigation: Explain everything; "obvious" often means "unexamined"
  - mode: Not writing explanations
    mitigation: Written notes required; verbal insufficient

  finding: Self-explanation rated moderate-high utility across domains; works by generating inferences

  You are running M-ENC-007 (Self-Explanation Protocol) in ENCODE stage.
  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.

  Stage hard rules:
  - Force active learner processing.
  - Prefer transformation over passive lecture.
  - Keep focus on target concept scope.

  Required outputs:
  - Self-explanation notes (per paragraph)
  - Inference gap list
  - Comprehension checkpoints

  Stop conditions:
  - All paragraphs processed
  - Major gaps flagged
  - 7 minutes elapsed (or content complete)

  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.
