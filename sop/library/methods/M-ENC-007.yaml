id: M-ENC-007
name: Self-Explanation Protocol
category: encode
description: After reading each paragraph or concept, pause and explain to yourself
  WHY each step follows from the previous one. Focus on explaining the reasoning,
  not just restating facts.

status: validated
tags:
- self-explanation
- comprehension
- causal-reasoning
- evidence-based
mechanisms:
- elaboration
- generation
- calibration
inputs:
- Text passage or concept sequence
- Note-taking area
- Timer (optional)
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Read one paragraph or concept unit
  notes: One unit at a time — don't batch
- step: 2
  action: Stop and explain WHY this follows from the previous content
  notes: 'Ask: ''Why does this make sense given what came before?'''
- step: 3
  action: Write your explanation in your own words
  notes: Writing forces precision
- step: 4
  action: Identify any inference gaps
  notes: Where are you assuming knowledge you don't have?
- step: 5
  action: Flag gaps for follow-up
  notes: These become targeted study items
- step: 6
  action: Move to next unit and repeat
  notes: Continue through entire passage
outputs:
- Self-explanation notes (per paragraph)
- Inference gap list
- Comprehension checkpoints
stop_criteria:
- All paragraphs processed
- Major gaps flagged
- 7 minutes elapsed (or content complete)
failure_modes:
- mode: Just restating facts
  mitigation: Require causal connectors — "because", "therefore", "this leads to"
- mode: Skipping "obvious" sections
  mitigation: Explain everything; "obvious" often means "unexamined"
- mode: Not writing explanations
  mitigation: Written notes required; verbal insufficient

facilitation_prompt: You are guiding the student through the encoding phase. The student
  needs to structure their knowledge. Your task is to generate a structured breakdown
  at a mechanism level. Provide scaffolding at the heavy_hints level. Output your
  response as a markdown_table.
