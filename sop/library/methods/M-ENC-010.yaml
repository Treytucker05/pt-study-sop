inputs:
  - 2-4 confusable concepts to compare
  - List of comparison dimensions/features
  - Source material for accuracy
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Create table with concepts as columns
    notes: 2-4 concepts optimal; more gets unwieldy
  - step: 2
    action: List comparison dimensions as rows
    notes: "Common dimensions: mechanism, presentation, treatment, prognosis"
  - step: 3
    action: Fill each cell from memory first
    notes: Retrieval before lookup
  - step: 4
    action: Check source material and correct errors
    notes: Note which cells you got wrong
  - step: 5
    action: Highlight the discriminating features
    notes: These are the key differentiators
  - step: 6
    action: Generate 1-2 "If...then" rules from discriminators
    notes: "Example: 'If painless jaundice → think pancreatic head cancer'"
outputs:
  - Completed comparison table
  - Discriminating features highlighted
  - Differential rules (1-2 per comparison)
  - Error list from initial attempt
stop_criteria:
  - All cells filled
  - Discriminators identified
  - Rules generated
failure_modes:
  - mode: Too many comparison dimensions
    mitigation: Limit to 5-7 rows; prioritize clinical relevance
  - mode: No discriminators identified
    mitigation: Force ranking — which row is MOST differentiating?
  - mode: Looking up before trying
    mitigation: Fill from memory first, then verify
