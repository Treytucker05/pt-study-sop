description: Create a side-by-side table comparing 2-4 confusable concepts across shared features. Highlight discriminating features. Builds differential diagnosis skill.
default_duration_min: 7
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: review
control_stage: ENCODE

tags:

  - comparison
  - discrimination
  - table
  - clinical
required_when_confusable: true
mechanisms:
  - discrimination
  - elaboration
  - dual_coding
inputs:
  - 2-4 confusable concepts to compare
  - List of comparison dimensions/features
  - Source material for accuracy
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Create table with concepts as columns
    notes: 2-4 concepts optimal; more gets unwieldy
  - step: 2
    action: List comparison dimensions as rows
    notes: "Common dimensions: mechanism, presentation, treatment, prognosis"
  - step: 3
    action: Fill each cell from memory first
    notes: Retrieval before lookup
  - step: 4
    action: Check source material and correct errors
    notes: Note which cells you got wrong
  - step: 5
    action: Highlight the discriminating features
    notes: These are the key differentiators
  - step: 6
    action: Generate 1-2 "If...then" rules from discriminators
    notes: "Example: 'If painless jaundice → think pancreatic head cancer'"
outputs:
  - Completed comparison table
  - Discriminating features highlighted
  - Differential rules (1-2 per comparison)
  - Error list from initial attempt
stop_criteria:
  - All cells filled
  - Discriminators identified
  - Rules generated
failure_modes:
  - mode: Too many comparison dimensions
    mitigation: Limit to 5-7 rows; prioritize clinical relevance
  - mode: No discriminators identified
    mitigation: Force ranking — which row is MOST differentiating?
  - mode: Looking up before trying
    mitigation: Fill from memory first, then verify
logging_fields:
  - concepts_compared
  - dimensions_used
  - discriminators_found
  - rules_generated
  - cells_corrected

  You are running this method card in its assigned control stage. Execute only what this card defines.

  Operational instructions:
  1) Confirm required inputs from the card before starting. If inputs are missing, request only the minimum missing input.
  2) Follow the listed steps in order and keep output concise, structured, and actionable.
  3) Enforce control-stage boundaries:
     - PRIME: orientation and structure only; no scored checks or hidden calibration.
     - CALIBRATE: measure current state with confidence + performance signals.
     - ENCODE: force active processing; avoid passive lecture-only output.
     - REFERENCE: build concrete anchors/artifacts before any retrieval demand.
     - RETRIEVE: require learner attempt before revealing full answers.
     - OVERLEARN: run bounded fluency reps and stop at fatigue/cap criteria.
  4) Produce the outputs/artifacts listed on this card.
  5) Stop when stop_criteria are met and log required telemetry fields.
