name: Mastery Loop
category: refine
description: Re-study items missed during retrieval, then immediately re-test. Repeat until all items are recalled correctly. Based on successive relearning (Rawson & Dunlosky).
default_duration_min: 10
energy_cost: medium

tags:

  - mastery
  - retest
  - evidence-based
mechanisms:
  - retrieval
  - spacing
  - successive_relearning
  - mastery_learning
inputs:
  - List of missed items from retrieval practice
  - Source materials for re-study
  - Testing mechanism (flashcards, quiz, or Tutor)
  - Loop tracker (to count iterations)
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify all items missed in recent retrieval practice
    notes: These are your mastery targets — items that need successive relearning
  - step: 2
    action: Re-study the first missed item using source materials
    notes: Brief focused study — 30-60 seconds per item, not lengthy review
  - step: 3
    action: Immediately re-test the item without looking at source
    notes: The test must come immediately after study — no delay
  - step: 4
    action: If correct, move to next missed item; if incorrect, mark for another loop
    notes: Track which items needed multiple loops
  - step: 5
    action: After all items attempted, loop back to any that were still incorrect
    notes: Continue until all items recalled correctly at least once
  - step: 6
    action: Record total loops needed per item for future spacing decisions
    notes: Items needing 3+ loops are weak anchors — schedule for earlier review
outputs:
  - Mastery achieved on all targeted items
  - Loop count per item (difficulty metric)
  - Weak anchor list (items needing 3+ loops)
  - Updated spacing recommendations
stop_criteria:
  - All items recalled correctly at least once
  - Maximum loop limit reached (e.g., 5 loops per item)
  - Time budget exhausted (with partial progress logged)
failure_modes:
  - mode: Re-studying too long before re-testing
    mitigation: Keep re-study brief (30-60 sec) — the test is where learning happens
  - mode: Stopping after first correct recall (no overlearning)
    mitigation: For weak items, aim for 2 correct recalls before moving on
  - mode: Not tracking loop counts
    mitigation: Loop counts are diagnostic — always record them
