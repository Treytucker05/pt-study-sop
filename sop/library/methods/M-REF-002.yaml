name: Mastery Loop
category: refine
description: Re-study items missed during retrieval, then immediately re-test. Repeat until all items are recalled correctly. Based on successive relearning (Rawson & Dunlosky).
default_duration_min: 10
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: consolidation
control_stage: REFERENCE
status: validated
tags:
  - successive-relearning
  - mastery
  - retest
  - evidence-based
mechanisms:
  - retrieval
  - spacing
  - successive_relearning
  - mastery_learning
inputs:
  - List of missed items from retrieval practice
  - Source materials for re-study
  - Testing mechanism (flashcards, quiz, or Tutor)
  - Loop tracker (to count iterations)
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify all items missed in recent retrieval practice
    notes: These are your mastery targets — items that need successive relearning
  - step: 2
    action: Re-study the first missed item using source materials
    notes: Brief focused study — 30-60 seconds per item, not lengthy review
  - step: 3
    action: Immediately re-test the item without looking at source
    notes: The test must come immediately after study — no delay
  - step: 4
    action: If correct, move to next missed item; if incorrect, mark for another loop
    notes: Track which items needed multiple loops
  - step: 5
    action: After all items attempted, loop back to any that were still incorrect
    notes: Continue until all items recalled correctly at least once
  - step: 6
    action: Record total loops needed per item for future spacing decisions
    notes: Items needing 3+ loops are weak anchors — schedule for earlier review
outputs:
  - Mastery achieved on all targeted items
  - Loop count per item (difficulty metric)
  - Weak anchor list (items needing 3+ loops)
  - Updated spacing recommendations
stop_criteria:
  - All items recalled correctly at least once
  - Maximum loop limit reached (e.g., 5 loops per item)
  - Time budget exhausted (with partial progress logged)
failure_modes:
  - mode: Re-studying too long before re-testing
    mitigation: Keep re-study brief (30-60 sec) — the test is where learning happens
  - mode: Stopping after first correct recall (no overlearning)
    mitigation: For weak items, aim for 2 correct recalls before moving on
  - mode: Not tracking loop counts
    mitigation: Loop counts are diagnostic — always record them

  You are running this method card in its assigned control stage. Execute only what this card defines.

  Operational instructions:
  1) Confirm required inputs from the card before starting. If inputs are missing, request only the minimum missing input.
  2) Follow the listed steps in order and keep output concise, structured, and actionable.
  3) Enforce control-stage boundaries:
     - PRIME: orientation and structure only; no scored checks or hidden calibration.
     - CALIBRATE: measure current state with confidence + performance signals.
     - ENCODE: force active processing; avoid passive lecture-only output.
     - REFERENCE: build concrete anchors/artifacts before any retrieval demand.
     - RETRIEVE: require learner attempt before revealing full answers.
     - OVERLEARN: run bounded fluency reps and stop at fatigue/cap criteria.
  4) Produce the outputs/artifacts listed on this card.
  5) Stop when stop_criteria are met and log required telemetry fields.
