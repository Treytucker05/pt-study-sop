id: M-ENC-001
name: KWIK Hook
category: encode
description: "Structured 6-step encoding protocol for new terms. Sound (phonetic cue) → Function (true meaning) → Image (vivid visual tied to function) → Entwine (PIE method: personal meaning) → Resonance (learner confirms it clicks) → Lock (record as card/log). Each step is gated — don't skip ahead."

mechanisms:

  - emotional_encoding
inputs:
  - New term or concept to encode
  - Definition or meaning from source material
  - Blank note area for hook creation
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: "Sound: Find a phonetic cue or rhyme that sounds like the term"
    notes: "Example: 'Sartorius' sounds like 'Sartorial' (relating to tailoring)"
  - step: 2
    action: "Function: State the true meaning/function in one sentence"
    notes: Must come from source material (Source-Lock)
  - step: 3
    action: "Image: Create a vivid mental image that connects sound to function"
    notes: The weirder/more emotional, the better for retention
  - step: 4
    action: "Entwine: Connect the image with personal meaning (PIE method)"
    notes: Add emotion, absurdity, or personal experience. Why does this matter to YOU?
  - step: 5
    action: "Resonance: Confirm aloud that the hook makes sense to you"
    notes: "Say: 'This clicks because...'"
  - step: 6
    action: "Lock: Record the hook as an Anki card or session log entry"
    notes: Capture for spaced repetition
outputs:
  - KWIK hook (sound-function-image triplet)
  - Anki card draft (optional)
  - Session log entry
stop_criteria:
  - All 6 steps completed
  - Hook feels "locked" (resonance confirmed)
  - 3 minutes elapsed per term
failure_modes:
  - mode: Skipping steps
    mitigation: Gate each step; don't proceed without completion
  - mode: Image too abstract
    mitigation: Make it concrete, visual, and bizarre
  - mode: Sound cue forced
    mitigation: If phonetics don't work, try acronym or first-letter cue
  - mode: Weak personal connection
    mitigation: Add emotion, stakes, or personal relevance - why does this matter to YOU?

  You are running M-ENC-001 (KWIK Hook) in ENCODE stage.
  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.

  Stage hard rules:
  - Force active learner processing.
  - Prefer transformation over passive lecture.
  - Keep focus on target concept scope.

  Required outputs:
  - KWIK hook (sound-function-image triplet)
  - Anki card draft (optional)
  - Session log entry

  Stop conditions:
  - All 6 steps completed
  - Hook feels "locked" (resonance confirmed)
  - 3 minutes elapsed per term

  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.
