name: Priority Set
category: prepare
description: Convert calibrate misses into a deterministic top-3 weakness set that drives ENCODE method selection.
default_duration_min: 3
energy_cost: low
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: CALIBRATE
status: draft
tags:
  - calibrate
  - prioritization
  - sequencing
mechanisms:
  - adaptive_sequencing
inputs:
  - Calibrate results
  - Confidence tags
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Group misses by weakness type
    notes: Use Recall/Confusion/Rule/Representation/Procedure/Computation/Speed
  - step: 2
    action: Rank weaknesses by impact and frequency
    notes: High-confidence misses rank above low-confidence misses
  - step: 3
    action: Select top 3 weaknesses for ENCODE
    notes: Output is deterministic and explicit
outputs:
  - PrioritySet (top 3 weaknesses)
  - Weakness to method mapping seed
stop_criteria:
  - Exactly 3 prioritized weaknesses
evidence:
  citation: Rawson & Dunlosky (2011)
  finding: Targeted corrective practice improves long-term retention more than broad restudy
  source: control-plane migration
evidence_raw: Rawson & Dunlosky (2011); focused relearning outperforms untargeted review

  You are running this method card in its assigned control stage. Execute only what this card defines.

  Operational instructions:
  1) Confirm required inputs from the card before starting. If inputs are missing, request only the minimum missing input.
  2) Follow the listed steps in order and keep output concise, structured, and actionable.
  3) Enforce control-stage boundaries:
     - PRIME: orientation and structure only; no scored checks or hidden calibration.
     - CALIBRATE: measure current state with confidence + performance signals.
     - ENCODE: force active processing; avoid passive lecture-only output.
     - REFERENCE: build concrete anchors/artifacts before any retrieval demand.
     - RETRIEVE: require learner attempt before revealing full answers.
     - OVERLEARN: run bounded fluency reps and stop at fatigue/cap criteria.
  4) Produce the outputs/artifacts listed on this card.
  5) Stop when stop_criteria are met and log required telemetry fields.
