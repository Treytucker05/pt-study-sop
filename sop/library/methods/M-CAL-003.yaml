description: Convert calibrate misses into a deterministic top-3 weakness set that drives ENCODE method selection.
default_duration_min: 3
energy_cost: low
best_stage: first_exposure
status: draft
tags:
  - calibrate
  - prioritization
  - sequencing
mechanisms:
  - adaptive_sequencing
inputs:
  - Calibrate results
  - Confidence tags
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Group misses by weakness type
    notes: Use Recall/Confusion/Rule/Representation/Procedure/Computation/Speed
  - step: 2
    action: Rank weaknesses by impact and frequency
    notes: High-confidence misses rank above low-confidence misses
  - step: 3
    action: Select top 3 weaknesses for ENCODE
    notes: Output is deterministic and explicit
outputs:
  - PrioritySet (top 3 weaknesses)
  - Weakness to method mapping seed
stop_criteria:
  - Exactly 3 prioritized weaknesses

  finding: Targeted corrective practice improves long-term retention more than broad restudy
  source: control-plane migration
evidence_raw: Rawson & Dunlosky (2011); focused relearning outperforms untargeted review
