id: M-PRE-006
name: Structural Skimming + Pillar Mapping
category: prepare
description: Rapidly skim headings/visual cues and map 3-5 top pillars before deep reading.
default_duration_min: 5
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: PRIME
status: validated
tags:
- skimming
- structure
- pillars
- cognitive-load
mechanisms:
- schema_activation
- chunking
stipulations:
- Use structural signals only (headings, subheadings, bold terms, diagrams).
- Do not summarize paragraphs at this stage.
- PRIME boundary applies: no scoring, no correctness judgment.
when_to_use:
- Slide decks, textbooks, lecture packets.
- Learners who need fast structure before details.
when_not_to_use:
- Highly spatial content where diagram-first review is required.
- Sessions with fewer than 3 minutes total.
knobs:
  pillar_count:
    type: int
    min: 3
    max: 5
    default: 4
  output_mode:
    type: enum
    options:
    - nested_list
    - numbered_spine
    - markdown_table
    default: nested_list
constraints:
  non_assessment: true
  paragraph_summaries_disallowed: true
inputs:
- Topic packet (headings + visual cues)
- Learning objectives (optional)
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Scan structural cues only
  notes: headings, subheadings, bold terms, diagrams.
- step: 2
  action: Extract 3-5 top pillars
  notes: Pillars should represent conceptual buckets.
- step: 3
  action: Map one-line descriptor under each pillar
  notes: Descriptor is structural, not explanatory.
- step: 4
  action: Link pillars to module objective IDs when available
  notes: Unlinked pillars get flagged for follow-up.
outputs:
- PillarMap
- ObjectiveLinks
- FollowUpTargets
stop_criteria:
- 3-5 pillars extracted
- Every pillar has descriptor text
- 5 minutes elapsed
failure_modes:
- mode: LLM drifts into paragraph summarization
  mitigation: Enforce structural-only extraction output.
- mode: Too many pillars
  mitigation: Cap at pillar_count and merge related nodes.
logging_fields:
- pillar_count
- objective_link_count
- follow_up_target_count
evidence:
  citation: Ausubel (1960)
  finding: Advance structure before detail improves assimilation of new material.
  source: research synthesis
evidence_strength: high
primary_citations:
- Ausubel (1960)
- Hattie (2009)
evidence_raw: Structural pre-exposure reduces overload and improves comprehension.
facilitation_prompt: 'You are running M-PRE-006 (Structural Skimming + Pillar Mapping) in PRIME.

  Use only structural cues; do not summarize full paragraphs.


  Produce:

  1) PillarMap (3-5 pillars, {output_mode})

  2) ObjectiveLinks

  3) FollowUpTargets


  Hard constraints:

  - Non-assessment.

  - Structural-only output.

  - Respect pillar_count cap.

  '
gating_rules:
- Do not assess or score the learner in PRIME.
- Stay at orientation level and avoid full solution reveal.
