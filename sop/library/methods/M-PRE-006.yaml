category: prepare
description: "Break topic into 3 layers: big picture, key details, edge cases. Process one layer at a time."
default_duration_min: 5
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: PRIME
status: validated
tags:
  - chunking
  - depth-first
  - structure
  - cognitive-load
mechanisms:
  - elaboration
  - desirable_difficulty
inputs:
  - Topic content (slides, notes, textbook section)
  - Three-column template (Big Picture | Key Details | Edge Cases)
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: "Layer 1 — Big Picture: Write the main concept in 1-2 sentences"
    notes: "Answer: What is this topic fundamentally about?"
  - step: 2
    action: "Layer 2 — Key Details: List 3-5 must-know facts"
    notes: These are the core testable items
  - step: 3
    action: "Layer 3 — Edge Cases: Note exceptions, special cases, clinical pearls"
    notes: These differentiate good from great understanding
  - step: 4
    action: Review layers in order — don't jump ahead
    notes: Each layer builds on the previous
  - step: 5
    action: Identify which layer needs most study time
    notes: Usually Layer 2 for exams; Layer 3 for clinical
outputs:
  - Three-layer breakdown document
  - Study priority assignment
  - Layered mental model
stop_criteria:
  - All three layers populated
  - Study priority identified
  - 5 minutes elapsed
failure_modes:
  - mode: Layers too unbalanced
    mitigation: Big Picture should be 1-2 sentences max; force brevity
  - mode: Skipping to edge cases too early
    mitigation: Gate Layer 3 until Layer 2 is solid
  - mode: Key details too vague
    mitigation: Require specific facts, not summaries
logging_fields:
  - big_picture_word_count
  - key_detail_count
  - edge_case_count
  - priority_layer

  You are running this method card in its assigned control stage. Execute only what this card defines.

  Operational instructions:
  1) Confirm required inputs from the card before starting. If inputs are missing, request only the minimum missing input.
  2) Follow the listed steps in order and keep output concise, structured, and actionable.
  3) Enforce control-stage boundaries:
     - PRIME: orientation and structure only; no scored checks or hidden calibration.
     - CALIBRATE: measure current state with confidence + performance signals.
     - ENCODE: force active processing; avoid passive lecture-only output.
     - REFERENCE: build concrete anchors/artifacts before any retrieval demand.
     - RETRIEVE: require learner attempt before revealing full answers.
     - OVERLEARN: run bounded fluency reps and stop at fatigue/cap criteria.
  4) Produce the outputs/artifacts listed on this card.
  5) Stop when stop_criteria are met and log required telemetry fields.
