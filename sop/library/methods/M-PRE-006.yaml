description: 'Break topic into 3 layers: big picture, key details, edge cases. Process
  one layer at a time.'
default_duration_min: 5
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: PRIME
status: validated
tags:
- chunking
- depth-first
- structure
- cognitive-load
mechanisms:
- elaboration
- desirable_difficulty
inputs:
- Topic content (slides, notes, textbook section)
- Three-column template (Big Picture | Key Details | Edge Cases)
steps:
- step: 1
  action: 'Layer 1 — Big Picture: Write the main concept in 1-2 sentences'
  notes: 'Answer: What is this topic fundamentally about?'
- step: 2
  action: 'Layer 2 — Key Details: List 3-5 must-know facts'
  notes: These are the core testable items
- step: 3
  action: 'Layer 3 — Edge Cases: Note exceptions, special cases, clinical pearls'
  notes: These differentiate good from great understanding
- step: 4
  action: Review layers in order — don't jump ahead
  notes: Each layer builds on the previous
- step: 5
  action: Identify which layer needs most study time
  notes: Usually Layer 2 for exams; Layer 3 for clinical
outputs:
- Three-layer breakdown document
- Study priority assignment
- Layered mental model
stop_criteria:
- All three layers populated
- Study priority identified
- 5 minutes elapsed
failure_modes:
- mode: Layers too unbalanced
  mitigation: Big Picture should be 1-2 sentences max; force brevity
- mode: Skipping to edge cases too early
  mitigation: Gate Layer 3 until Layer 2 is solid
- mode: Key details too vague
  mitigation: Require specific facts, not summaries

facilitation_prompt: You are an expert tutor preparing the student for a new topic.
  Using a supportive_synthesis approach, help the student map their existing knowledge
  to the upcoming concept. Keep the focus at a definition level to serve as an advance
  organizer.
