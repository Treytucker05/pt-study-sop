name: Chain Linking
category: encode
description: Create a bizarre narrative story connecting unrelated items. The absurdity makes it memorable without spatial
  locations.
default_duration_min: 8
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: first_exposure

status: validated
tags:

knobs:
  guidance_level: medium
  output_format: bullets
constraints:
  active_processing_required: true
  objective_scope_required: true
  no_final_answer_only: true
inputs:
- List of items to memorize in order
- Creativity for bizarre connections
steps:
- step: 1
  action: List items in order
  notes: 5-8 items optimal for one chain
- step: 2
  action: Create vivid image for item 1
  notes: See it clearly
- step: 3
  action: Connect item 1 to 2 with absurd interaction
  notes: The more bizarre, the better
- step: 4
  action: Continue linking each item
  notes: Each interacts with the next
- step: 5
  action: Walk through the story
  notes: Replay the narrative
- step: 6
  action: Test retrieval by "pulling the chain"
  notes: Start anywhere, follow links
outputs:
- Bizarre story narrative
- Retrieval success rate
- Weak links (breaks in chain)
stop_criteria:
- Story complete with all items
- Can retrieve entire sequence
- Backward retrieval also possible
failure_modes:
- mode: Story too logical
  mitigation: Add absurd elements; gravity-defying, impossible actions
- mode: Weak links
  mitigation: Make interactions sensory and emotional
- mode: Chain too long
  mitigation: Split into multiple chains if >8 items
logging_fields:
- items_linked
- story_length
- retrieval_accuracy
- chain_breaks

facilitation_prompt: 'You are running M-ENC-014 (Chain Linking) in ENCODE stage.

  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.


  Stage hard rules:

  - Force active learner processing.

  - Prefer transformation over passive lecture.

  - Keep focus on target concept scope.


  Required outputs:

  - Bizarre story narrative

  - Retrieval success rate

  - Weak links (breaks in chain)


  Stop conditions:

  - Story complete with all items

  - Can retrieve entire sequence

  - Backward retrieval also possible


  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.

  '
gating_rules:
- Force active processing (explain, transform, or map), not passive reading.
- Keep output scoped to mapped objectives only.
