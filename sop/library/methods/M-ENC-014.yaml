description: Create a bizarre narrative story connecting unrelated items. The absurdity
  makes it memorable without spatial locations.

tags:
- memory
- narrative
- sequence
- absurdity
- kwik-inspired
mechanisms:
- elaboration
- narrative_encoding
- generation
inputs:
- List of items to memorize in order
- Creativity for bizarre connections
steps:
- step: 1
  action: List items in order
  notes: 5-8 items optimal for one chain
- step: 2
  action: Create vivid image for item 1
  notes: See it clearly
- step: 3
  action: Connect item 1 to 2 with absurd interaction
  notes: The more bizarre, the better
- step: 4
  action: Continue linking each item
  notes: Each interacts with the next
- step: 5
  action: Walk through the story
  notes: Replay the narrative
- step: 6
  action: Test retrieval by "pulling the chain"
  notes: Start anywhere, follow links
outputs:
- Bizarre story narrative
- Retrieval success rate
- Weak links (breaks in chain)
stop_criteria:
- Story complete with all items
- Can retrieve entire sequence
- Backward retrieval also possible
failure_modes:
- mode: Story too logical
  mitigation: Add absurd elements; gravity-defying, impossible actions
- mode: Weak links
  mitigation: Make interactions sensory and emotional
- mode: Chain too long
  mitigation: Split into multiple chains if >8 items
logging_fields:
- items_linked
- story_length
- retrieval_accuracy
- chain_breaks

facilitation_prompt: You are guiding the student through the encoding phase. The student
  needs to structure their knowledge. Your task is to generate a structured breakdown
  at a mechanism level. Provide scaffolding at the heavy_hints level. Output your
  response as a markdown_table.
