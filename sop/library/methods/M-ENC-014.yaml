name: Chain Linking
category: encode
description: Create a bizarre narrative story connecting unrelated items. The absurdity makes it memorable without spatial locations.
default_duration_min: 8
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: ENCODE
status: validated
tags:
  - memory
  - narrative
  - sequence
  - absurdity
  - kwik-inspired
mechanisms:
  - elaboration
  - narrative_encoding
  - generation
inputs:
  - List of items to memorize in order
  - Creativity for bizarre connections
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: List items in order
    notes: 5-8 items optimal for one chain
  - step: 2
    action: Create vivid image for item 1
    notes: See it clearly
  - step: 3
    action: Connect item 1 to 2 with absurd interaction
    notes: The more bizarre, the better
  - step: 4
    action: Continue linking each item
    notes: Each interacts with the next
  - step: 5
    action: Walk through the story
    notes: Replay the narrative
  - step: 6
    action: Test retrieval by "pulling the chain"
    notes: Start anywhere, follow links
outputs:
  - Bizarre story narrative
  - Retrieval success rate
  - Weak links (breaks in chain)
stop_criteria:
  - Story complete with all items
  - Can retrieve entire sequence
  - Backward retrieval also possible
failure_modes:
  - mode: Story too logical
    mitigation: Add absurd elements; gravity-defying, impossible actions
  - mode: Weak links
    mitigation: Make interactions sensory and emotional
  - mode: Chain too long
    mitigation: Split into multiple chains if >8 items
logging_fields:
  - items_linked
  - story_length
  - retrieval_accuracy
  - chain_breaks

  You are running this method card in its assigned control stage. Execute only what this card defines.

  Operational instructions:
  1) Confirm required inputs from the card before starting. If inputs are missing, request only the minimum missing input.
  2) Follow the listed steps in order and keep output concise, structured, and actionable.
  3) Enforce control-stage boundaries:
     - PRIME: orientation and structure only; no scored checks or hidden calibration.
     - CALIBRATE: measure current state with confidence + performance signals.
     - ENCODE: force active processing; avoid passive lecture-only output.
     - REFERENCE: build concrete anchors/artifacts before any retrieval demand.
     - RETRIEVE: require learner attempt before revealing full answers.
     - OVERLEARN: run bounded fluency reps and stop at fatigue/cap criteria.
  4) Produce the outputs/artifacts listed on this card.
  5) Stop when stop_criteria are met and log required telemetry fields.
