name: Skeleton Concept Hierarchy
category: prepare
description: Generate a bare concept hierarchy (topic core -> 4-6 categories -> short descriptors) without deep explanations.
default_duration_min: 5
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: PRIME
status: validated
tags:
  - organization
  - visual
  - grouping
  - chunking
mechanisms:
  - elaboration
  - discrimination
stipulations:
  - Keep map skeletal: depth limited to 2 levels.
  - Use descriptors only; avoid explanation paragraphs.
  - PRIME boundary applies: no scoring.
when_to_use:
  - Big-picture orientation for integrative topics.
  - Learners who think visually and need category scaffolding.
when_not_to_use:
  - Pure procedural skill acquisition where step flow is primary.
  - Sessions with <3 minutes available.
knobs:
  node_count_cap:
    type: int
    min: 4
    max: 8
    default: 6
  map_format:
    type: enum
    options: [ascii_tree, mermaid, nested_bullets]
    default: ascii_tree
constraints:
  non_assessment: true
  max_depth: 2
inputs:
  - Topic title
  - Section headings or term list
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Set central node as topic
    notes: Single core node only.
  - step: 2
    action: Derive 4-6 first-ring categories
    notes: Categories should be mutually distinct.
  - step: 3
    action: Attach 1-2 descriptor tokens under each category
    notes: Descriptors are labels, not explanations.
  - step: 4
    action: Add cross-links between categories where needed
    notes: Use short relation labels only.
outputs:
  - SkeletonMap
  - CategoryLabels
  - CrossLinks
stop_criteria:
  - First-ring categories between 4 and 6
  - Map depth <=2
  - 5 minutes elapsed
failure_modes:
  - mode: Map turns into paragraph notes
    mitigation: Enforce descriptor-only output.
  - mode: Too many nodes causing overload
    mitigation: Apply node_count_cap and drop leaf-level detail.
logging_fields:
  - category_count
  - cross_link_count
  - map_depth

facilitation_prompt: |
  You are running M-PRE-005 (Skeleton Concept Hierarchy) in PRIME stage.
  Build a bare hierarchy, not explanations.

  Rules:
  - Central topic -> 4-6 categories -> 1-2 descriptors each.
  - Depth max = 2.
  - Use {map_format}; respect node_count_cap.
  - No scoring or quiz prompts.

  Return:
  1) SkeletonMap
  2) CategoryLabels
  3) CrossLinks
