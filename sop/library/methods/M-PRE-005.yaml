category: prepare
description: Group related terms/concepts into 3-5 clusters. Identify hierarchy and relationships.
default_duration_min: 5
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: PRIME
status: validated
tags:
  - organization
  - visual
  - grouping
  - chunking
mechanisms:
  - elaboration
  - discrimination
inputs:
  - List of terms/concepts from the topic (10-20 items)
  - Blank paper or whiteboard
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: List all key terms from the topic
    notes: Extract from headings, bold text, or term lists
  - step: 2
    action: Sort terms into 3-5 natural groupings
    notes: "Look for: shared function, shared location, shared mechanism"
  - step: 3
    action: Name each cluster with a descriptive label
    notes: The label should capture what unifies the group
  - step: 4
    action: Arrange clusters spatially to show relationships
    notes: Related clusters closer together; hierarchies top-to-bottom
  - step: 5
    action: Draw connecting lines between related clusters
    notes: Label connections with relationship type
outputs:
  - Cluster diagram (3-5 labeled groups)
  - Inter-cluster relationships mapped
  - Visual organization of topic
stop_criteria:
  - All terms assigned to clusters
  - Clusters named
  - 5 minutes elapsed
failure_modes:
  - mode: Too many clusters (>5)
    mitigation: Force consolidation; look for super-categories
  - mode: Clusters too uneven (one has 80% of terms)
    mitigation: Split large clusters by sub-function
  - mode: Terms don't fit any cluster
    mitigation: Create "Misc" cluster; these may be edge cases or prerequisites
logging_fields:
  - cluster_count
