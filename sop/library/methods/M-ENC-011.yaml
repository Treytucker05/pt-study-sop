inputs:
- Process or algorithm to diagram
- Source material with step sequence
- Mermaid editor or blank paper
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Identify the start point (input/trigger)
  notes: What initiates this process?
- step: 2
  action: List all steps in sequential order
  notes: Include every decision point
- step: 3
  action: Draw boxes for steps, diamonds for decisions
  notes: Standard flowchart conventions
- step: 4
  action: Connect with arrows showing flow direction
  notes: Label decision branches (Yes/No, High/Low)
- step: 5
  action: Identify loops and feedback points
  notes: Where does the process repeat or reset?
- step: 6
  action: Verify against source material
  notes: Flag any missing or incorrect steps
outputs:
- Completed flowchart
- Mermaid code (if using dashboard)
- Decision point list
- Loop/feedback points identified
stop_criteria:
- All steps included
- All decisions branched correctly
- Flowchart verified against source
failure_modes:
- mode: Missing decision branches
  mitigation: Every diamond must have labeled Yes/No paths
- mode: Linear-only thinking
  mitigation: Actively look for loops and feedback
- mode: Too complex single diagram
  mitigation: Split into sub-processes if >12 steps

facilitation_prompt: 'You are running M-ENC-011 (Process Flowchart) in ENCODE stage.

  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.


  Stage hard rules:

  - Force active learner processing.

  - Prefer transformation over passive lecture.

  - Keep focus on target concept scope.


  Required outputs:

  - Completed flowchart

  - Mermaid code (if using dashboard)

  - Decision point list

  - Loop/feedback points identified


  Stop conditions:

  - All steps included

  - All decisions branched correctly

  - Flowchart verified against source


  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.

  '
gating_rules:
- Force active processing (explain, transform, or map), not passive reading.
- Keep output scoped to mapped objectives only.
