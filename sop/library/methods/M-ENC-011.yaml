name: Process Flowchart
category: encode
description: Draw a sequential diagram showing a process, pathway, or algorithm. Include decision points where applicable. Use Mermaid graph TD syntax for dashboard editor.
default_duration_min: 10
energy_cost: high
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: ENCODE
status: validated
tags:
  - visual
  - mermaid
  - sequential

mechanisms:
  - elaboration
  - dual_coding
  - generation
inputs:
  - Process or algorithm to diagram
  - Source material with step sequence
  - Mermaid editor or blank paper
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify the start point (input/trigger)
    notes: What initiates this process?
  - step: 2
    action: List all steps in sequential order
    notes: Include every decision point
  - step: 3
    action: Draw boxes for steps, diamonds for decisions
    notes: Standard flowchart conventions
  - step: 4
    action: Connect with arrows showing flow direction
    notes: Label decision branches (Yes/No, High/Low)
  - step: 5
    action: Identify loops and feedback points
    notes: Where does the process repeat or reset?
  - step: 6
    action: Verify against source material
    notes: Flag any missing or incorrect steps
outputs:
  - Completed flowchart
  - Mermaid code (if using dashboard)
  - Decision point list
  - Loop/feedback points identified
stop_criteria:
  - All steps included
  - All decisions branched correctly
  - Flowchart verified against source
failure_modes:
  - mode: Missing decision branches
    mitigation: Every diamond must have labeled Yes/No paths
  - mode: Linear-only thinking
    mitigation: Actively look for loops and feedback
  - mode: Too complex single diagram
    mitigation: Split into sub-processes if >12 steps
logging_fields:
  - process_charted
  - step_count
  - decision_count
  - loop_count
  - verification_status

  You are running this method card in its assigned control stage. Execute only what this card defines.

  Operational instructions:
  1) Confirm required inputs from the card before starting. If inputs are missing, request only the minimum missing input.
  2) Follow the listed steps in order and keep output concise, structured, and actionable.
  3) Enforce control-stage boundaries:
     - PRIME: orientation and structure only; no scored checks or hidden calibration.
     - CALIBRATE: measure current state with confidence + performance signals.
     - ENCODE: force active processing; avoid passive lecture-only output.
     - REFERENCE: build concrete anchors/artifacts before any retrieval demand.
     - RETRIEVE: require learner attempt before revealing full answers.
     - OVERLEARN: run bounded fluency reps and stop at fatigue/cap criteria.
  4) Produce the outputs/artifacts listed on this card.
  5) Stop when stop_criteria are met and log required telemetry fields.
