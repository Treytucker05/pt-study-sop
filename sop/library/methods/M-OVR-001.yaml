inputs:
- Completed study session
- Exit ticket template (3 questions)
- Session notes or artifacts for reference
steps:
- step: 1
  action: 'Answer Question 1: ''What did I learn today?'''
  notes: Free recall format — blurt 3-5 key takeaways without looking at notes
- step: 2
  action: 'Answer Question 2: ''What''s still muddy?'''
  notes: Identify 1-2 specific confusions, gaps, or uncertain areas
- step: 3
  action: 'Answer Question 3: ''What''s my next action?'''
  notes: Concrete, specific next step — not vague ("review more")
- step: 4
  action: Review your blurt against session materials
  notes: Did you miss any major points? Add them if critical.
- step: 5
  action: Convert muddy points into specific questions for next session
  notes: Transform 'I'm confused about X' into 'How does X work when Y?'
- step: 6
  action: Log exit ticket to session record
  notes: This feeds into scheduling and gap tracking systems
outputs:
- Exit ticket (3-part response)
- Key takeaways list
- Muddy points / weak anchors
- Next action commitment
- Questions for next session
stop_criteria:
- All three questions answered
- Next action is specific and actionable
- Exit ticket logged to session record
failure_modes:
- mode: Generic answers ("I learned a lot")
  mitigation: Force specificity — name actual concepts, facts, or skills
- mode: Skipping the muddy point question
  mitigation: Something is always muddy — dig for it
- mode: Vague next action ("study more")
  mitigation: Next action must pass the "could I do this in 15 min?" test

  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.


  Stage hard rules:

  - Run bounded fluency reps.

  - Respect fatigue and stop caps.

  - Prioritize durable retention over speed only.


  Required outputs:

  - Exit ticket (3-part response)

  - Key takeaways list

  - Muddy points / weak anchors

  - Next action commitment

  - Questions for next session


  Stop conditions:

  - All three questions answered

  - Next action is specific and actionable

  - Exit ticket logged to session record


  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.

  '
gating_rules:
- Run only after stable retrieval performance.
- Stop after cap is met to avoid burnout loops.
