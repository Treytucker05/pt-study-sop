    action: Explain the concept aloud as if to a first-year student
    notes: Use simple language; avoid jargon

    action: Note any points where you stumble or hesitate
    notes: These are knowledge gaps
  - step: 4
    action: Answer the imaginary student's "why?" and "how?" questions
    notes: Force yourself to go deeper
  - step: 5
    action: Identify breakdown points
    notes: Where did the explanation fail?
  - step: 6
    action: Return to source for breakdown areas only
    notes: Targeted review, not full re-read
outputs:
  - Verbal explanation (recorded or noted)

  - 5 minutes elapsed
failure_modes:
  - mode: Reading instead of explaining
    mitigation: Close source material during teach-back
  - mode: Skipping "dumb" questions
    mitigation: Force "why?" after every statement
  - mode: Not identifying breakdowns
    mitigation: Record and listen back; gaps become obvious
