inputs:
- Concept to teach
- Imaginary student (or real one)
- Recording device (optional)
steps:
- step: 1
  action: State the concept you will teach
  notes: Be specific about scope
- step: 2
  action: Explain the concept aloud as if to a first-year student
  notes: Use simple language; avoid jargon
- step: 3
  action: Note any points where you stumble or hesitate
  notes: These are knowledge gaps
- step: 4
  action: Answer the imaginary student's "why?" and "how?" questions
  notes: Force yourself to go deeper
- step: 5
  action: Identify breakdown points
  notes: Where did the explanation fail?
- step: 6
  action: Return to source for breakdown areas only
  notes: Targeted review, not full re-read
outputs:
- Verbal explanation (recorded or noted)
- Breakdown points list
- Targeted review areas
stop_criteria:
- Full explanation delivered
- Breakdown points identified
- 5 minutes elapsed
failure_modes:
- mode: Reading instead of explaining
  mitigation: Close source material during teach-back
- mode: Skipping "dumb" questions
  mitigation: Force "why?" after every statement
- mode: Not identifying breakdowns
  mitigation: Record and listen back; gaps become obvious

facilitation_prompt: 'You are running M-ENC-004 (Teach-Back) in ENCODE stage.

  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.


  Stage hard rules:

  - Force active learner processing.

  - Prefer transformation over passive lecture.

  - Keep focus on target concept scope.


  Required outputs:

  - Verbal explanation (recorded or noted)

  - Breakdown points list

  - Targeted review areas


  Stop conditions:

  - Full explanation delivered

  - Breakdown points identified

  - 5 minutes elapsed


  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.

  '
gating_rules:
- Force active processing (explain, transform, or map), not passive reading.
- Keep output scoped to mapped objectives only.
