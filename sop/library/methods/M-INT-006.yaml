name: Illness Script Builder
category: interrogate
description: "For a condition, build the illness script: (1) enabling conditions, (2) pathophysiological fault, (3) clinical consequences. Compare your script to the textbook version."
default_duration_min: 10
energy_cost: high
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: ENCODE
status: validated
tags:
  - illness-script
  - clinical-reasoning
  - pathology
  - sop-core
mechanisms:
  - elaboration
  - generation
  - transfer
inputs:
  - Condition/disease to script
  - Source material with pathophysiology
  - Illness script template
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: "Write Enabling Conditions: Who gets this? Risk factors? Epidemiology?"
    notes: "Example: 'Elderly, smoker, male, hypertension'"
  - step: 2
    action: "Write Pathophysiological Fault: What goes wrong? Mechanism?"
    notes: "Example: 'Atherosclerotic plaque rupture leads to thrombosis'"
  - step: 3
    action: "Write Clinical Consequences: What symptoms and signs result?"
    notes: "Example: 'Chest pain, dyspnea, diaphoresis, ST elevation'"
  - step: 4
    action: Connect the three parts with causal arrows
    notes: Enabling leads to Fault leads to Consequences
  - step: 5
    action: Compare your script to textbook/source version
    notes: Note what you missed or got wrong
  - step: 6
    action: Add discriminating features vs. similar conditions
    notes: What separates this illness script from look-alikes?
outputs:
  - Complete illness script (3 parts)
  - Causal chain diagram
  - Comparison to textbook
  - Discriminating features
stop_criteria:
  - All three script parts completed
  - Causal chain drawn
  - Compared to source
failure_modes:
  - mode: Consequences without mechanism
    mitigation: Require explicit pathophysiological link
  - mode: Generic enabling conditions
    mitigation: Be specific — which risk factors are most important?
  - mode: Not discriminating from similar conditions
    mitigation: Always add "unlike [X] which has..."
logging_fields:
  - condition_scripted
  - enabling_conditions_count
  - consequences_count
  - discriminators_added

  You are running this method card in its assigned control stage. Execute only what this card defines.

  Operational instructions:
  1) Confirm required inputs from the card before starting. If inputs are missing, request only the minimum missing input.
  2) Follow the listed steps in order and keep output concise, structured, and actionable.
  3) Enforce control-stage boundaries:
     - PRIME: orientation and structure only; no scored checks or hidden calibration.
     - CALIBRATE: measure current state with confidence + performance signals.
     - ENCODE: force active processing; avoid passive lecture-only output.
     - REFERENCE: build concrete anchors/artifacts before any retrieval demand.
     - RETRIEVE: require learner attempt before revealing full answers.
     - OVERLEARN: run bounded fluency reps and stop at fatigue/cap criteria.
  4) Produce the outputs/artifacts listed on this card.
  5) Stop when stop_criteria are met and log required telemetry fields.
