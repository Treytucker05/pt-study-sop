name: Illness Script Builder
category: interrogate
description: "For a condition, build the illness script: (1) enabling conditions, (2) pathophysiological fault, (3) clinical consequences. Compare your script to the textbook version."

tags:
  - illness-script
  - clinical-reasoning
  - pathology
  - sop-core
mechanisms:
  - elaboration
  - generation
  - transfer
inputs:
  - Condition/disease to script
  - Source material with pathophysiology
  - Illness script template
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: "Write Enabling Conditions: Who gets this? Risk factors? Epidemiology?"
    notes: "Example: 'Elderly, smoker, male, hypertension'"
  - step: 2
    action: "Write Pathophysiological Fault: What goes wrong? Mechanism?"
    notes: "Example: 'Atherosclerotic plaque rupture leads to thrombosis'"
  - step: 3
    action: "Write Clinical Consequences: What symptoms and signs result?"
    notes: "Example: 'Chest pain, dyspnea, diaphoresis, ST elevation'"
  - step: 4
    action: Connect the three parts with causal arrows
    notes: Enabling leads to Fault leads to Consequences
  - step: 5
    action: Compare your script to textbook/source version
    notes: Note what you missed or got wrong
  - step: 6
    action: Add discriminating features vs. similar conditions
    notes: What separates this illness script from look-alikes?
outputs:
  - Complete illness script (3 parts)
  - Causal chain diagram
  - Comparison to textbook
  - Discriminating features
stop_criteria:
  - All three script parts completed
  - Causal chain drawn
  - Compared to source
failure_modes:
  - mode: Consequences without mechanism
    mitigation: Require explicit pathophysiological link
  - mode: Generic enabling conditions
    mitigation: Be specific — which risk factors are most important?
  - mode: Not discriminating from similar conditions
    mitigation: Always add "unlike [X] which has..."
