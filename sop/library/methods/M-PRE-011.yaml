description: 'Hand-draw a spatial mind map of the topic structure using own words, simple pictures, colors, and spatial positioning. Close eyes afterward to recall layout — positions trigger details. Max 5 minutes, never full rewrite.'
default_duration_min: 5
energy_cost: medium

tags:
- spatial
- hand-draw
- mind-map
- visual
- encoding
- own-words
mechanisms:
- dual_coding
- generation
- spatial_encoding
- motor_encoding
stipulations:
- Own words only — never copy verbatim from source
- Simple pictures and colors, not artistic drawings
- Max 5 minutes per block, max 1-2 hand-draws per session
- Purpose is spatial encoding, not note-taking
when_to_use:
- After receiving a structural overview (H1 map or advance organizer)
- When spatial positioning aids recall (anatomy, pathways, hierarchies)
- First exposure to new material with clear structure
when_not_to_use:
- Material is purely procedural or sequential (use flowchart instead)
- Time is severely constrained (<15 min total session)
- Learner has already hand-drawn this topic recently
knobs:
  map_style:
    type: enum
    options:
    - radial
    - hierarchical
    - freeform
    default: radial

  own_words_required: true
inputs:
- Structural overview or H1 map from prior PRIME block
- Blank paper and colored pens/markers
- Timer set to 5 minutes
steps:
- step: 1
  action: 'Review the structural overview from the previous block'
  notes: 'Spend 30 seconds scanning — do NOT start drawing yet'
- step: 2
  action: 'Place the central concept in the middle of the page'
  notes: 'Use your own words, not the textbook label'
- step: 3
  action: 'Draw 3-5 main branches using different colors'
  notes: 'Each branch = one pillar or major category'
- step: 4
  action: 'Add simple pictures or icons to anchor key concepts'
  notes: 'Stick figures, arrows, symbols — not art. Speed over beauty'
- step: 5
  action: 'Close eyes and mentally walk through the map layout'
  notes: 'Can you see the positions? Colors? Pictures? This is the spatial recall test'
outputs:
- Hand-drawn spatial mind map (physical artifact)
- Spatial recall confidence (can you see the layout with eyes closed?)
stop_criteria:
- 5-minute timer ends (hard stop)
- Map has central concept + 3-5 branches with at least 1 picture each
- Eyes-closed spatial recall attempted
failure_modes:
- mode: Spending too long on drawing quality
  mitigation: 'Set timer visible. Ugly is fine — speed over beauty'
- mode: Copying verbatim from source
  mitigation: 'Close source material. Draw from memory of overview'
- mode: Drawing too many branches (overload)
  mitigation: 'Cap at branch_limit. Combine related items'
- mode: Skipping the eyes-closed recall step
  mitigation: 'This IS the point. 10 seconds minimum with eyes closed'
logging_fields:
- branch_count

- Do not assess or score the learner in PRIME.
- Stay at orientation level — this is encoding, not retrieval.

facilitation_prompt: |
  You are running M-PRE-011 (Hand-Draw Map) in PRIME stage.
  Guide the learner to create a spatial mind map of the topic structure.

  Requirements:
  - Learner reviews the structural overview (30 sec scan, no drawing yet).
  - Central concept placed in middle of page using own words.
  - Draw {branch_limit} main branches using different colors.
  - Add simple pictures/icons to anchor key concepts (speed over beauty).
  - Close eyes and mentally walk through the map layout.

  Return exactly:
  1) MapStructureConfirmation (central concept + branch count)
  2) SpatialRecallConfidence (can learner see layout with eyes closed?)
  3) TimeSpent (hard stop at {time_cap_minutes} min)

  This is a non-assessment activity. Do not quiz or score the learner.
  This is orientation-level encoding, not retrieval.
