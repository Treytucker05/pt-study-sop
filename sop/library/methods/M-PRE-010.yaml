when_to_use:
  - Session start for any new module/topic.
  - Re-entry after long gap where objective state must be re-anchored.
when_not_to_use:
  - Never skip for first exposure; this is the mandatory PRIME gate.
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Resolve objective source
    notes: Load North Star first; use instructor learning objectives first; only synthesize from source material when instructor objectives are missing.
  - step: 2
    action: Build objective view by scope
    notes: module_all => publish full module objective map; single_focus => publish one measurable objective card.
  - step: 3
    action: Define focus target
    notes: module_all => learner selects one focus objective for zoom-in; single_focus => focus objective already fixed.
  - step: 4
    action: Request learner acknowledgment
    notes: Confirmation only, not scored probing.
outputs:
  - ModuleObjectiveMap
  - FocusObjectiveCard
  - SelectedFocusObjectiveId
  - LearnerAcknowledgment
stop_criteria:
  - module_all scope publishes all active module objectives from North Star
  - single_focus scope publishes exactly one measurable focus objective
  - focus objective is selected for downstream chain steps
  - learner acknowledges goals before PRIME continues

  You are running M-PRE-010 (Learning Objectives Primer) in PRIME stage.
  This stage is non-assessment: do not quiz, grade, or run retrieval checks.

  Objective source precedence:
  1) Instructor-provided learning objectives (use verbatim whenever available)
  2) Source-material-derived objectives (only if instructor objectives are missing)

  Operate by {objective_scope}:
  - module_all: publish a high-level map of all active module objectives from North Star, then ask learner to pick one focus objective for zoom-in.
  - single_focus: publish exactly one measurable focus objective card.

  Use {cognitive_depth} level and {delivery_style} tone. Ask for learner acknowledgment only, then stop.
  Do not begin core teaching content inside this method.
