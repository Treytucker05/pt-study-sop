inputs:
- Objectives
- One-Page Anchor
- Assessment mode selector
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Generate 10-20 questions tied to objective IDs
  notes: Distribute across selected assessment mode
- step: 2
  action: Tag each item with mode and objective_id
  notes: Ensure coverage across objectives
- step: 3
  action: Mark high-risk confusable items for adversarial drills
  notes: Feed directly into RETRIEVE stage
outputs:
- Question Bank Seed (10-20 items, mode-tagged)
- Coverage check draft
stop_criteria:
- At least 10 and at most 20 items
- Every item tagged by objective and assessment mode
evidence:
  citation: Roediger & Karpicke (2006)
  finding: Retrieval-oriented item generation improves durable recall performance
  source: control-plane migration
evidence_raw: Roediger & Karpicke (2006); retrieval practice outperforms rereading for retention
facilitation_prompt: 'You are running M-REF-004 (Question Bank Seed) in REFERENCE stage.

  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.


  Stage hard rules:

  - Build concrete anchors and artifacts.

  - Map concept to applied context.

  - Do not skip artifact creation.


  Required outputs:

  - Question Bank Seed (10-20 items, mode-tagged)

  - Coverage check draft


  Stop conditions:

  - At least 10 and at most 20 items

  - Every item tagged by objective and assessment mode


  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.

  '
gating_rules:
- Produce structured targets that RETRIEVE can directly test.
- No retrieval drills until reference targets are explicit.
failure_modes:
- mode: Artifact too vague for retrieval
  mitigation: Rewrite targets into explicit prompts/answers.
- mode: Reference bloat
  mitigation: Trim to objective-critical content only.
