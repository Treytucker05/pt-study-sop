name: Question Bank Seed
category: interrogate
description: Generate a mode-tagged seed bank of 10-20 retrieval questions from objectives and anchor artifacts.
default_duration_min: 8
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: exam_prep
control_stage: REFERENCE
status: draft
artifact_type: outline
tags:
  - reference
  - question-bank
  - retrieval-design
mechanisms:
  - retrieval
  - transfer
inputs:
  - Objectives
  - One-Page Anchor
  - Assessment mode selector
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Generate 10-20 questions tied to objective IDs
    notes: Distribute across selected assessment mode
  - step: 2
    action: Tag each item with mode and objective_id
    notes: Ensure coverage across objectives
  - step: 3
    action: Mark high-risk confusable items for adversarial drills
    notes: Feed directly into RETRIEVE stage
outputs:
  - Question Bank Seed (10-20 items, mode-tagged)
  - Coverage check draft
stop_criteria:
  - At least 10 and at most 20 items
  - Every item tagged by objective and assessment mode
evidence:
  citation: Roediger & Karpicke (2006)
  finding: Retrieval-oriented item generation improves durable recall performance
  source: control-plane migration
evidence_raw: Roediger & Karpicke (2006); retrieval practice outperforms rereading for retention

  You are running this method card in its assigned control stage. Execute only what this card defines.

  Operational instructions:
  1) Confirm required inputs from the card before starting. If inputs are missing, request only the minimum missing input.
  2) Follow the listed steps in order and keep output concise, structured, and actionable.
  3) Enforce control-stage boundaries:
     - PRIME: orientation and structure only; no scored checks or hidden calibration.
     - CALIBRATE: measure current state with confidence + performance signals.
     - ENCODE: force active processing; avoid passive lecture-only output.
     - REFERENCE: build concrete anchors/artifacts before any retrieval demand.
     - RETRIEVE: require learner attempt before revealing full answers.
     - OVERLEARN: run bounded fluency reps and stop at fatigue/cap criteria.
  4) Produce the outputs/artifacts listed on this card.
  5) Stop when stop_criteria are met and log required telemetry fields.
