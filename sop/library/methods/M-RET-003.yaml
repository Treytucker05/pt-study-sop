inputs:
- Notes or text with key terms identified
- Cloze deletion tool (or manually blanked printout)
- Answer key for verification
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Prepare cloze material by blanking key terms (or use pre-made)
  notes: Target vocabulary, definitions, key names, and critical facts
- step: 2
  action: Read each sentence with the blank
  notes: Use context clues — this is cued recall, not free recall
- step: 3
  action: Write or speak the missing term before checking
  notes: Commit to answer first — no peeking at answer key
- step: 4
  action: Check answer immediately after each item
  notes: Immediate feedback strengthens correct memories, corrects errors
- step: 5
  action: Mark items missed for targeted review
  notes: Create a miss list for focused re-study
- step: 6
  action: Re-attempt missed items after completing all blanks
  notes: Second pass often shows improvement — track this
outputs:
- Completed cloze exercise
- Accuracy count (correct/total blanks)
- Miss list for targeted review
- Second-pass improvement rate
stop_criteria:
- All blanks attempted
- Second pass on missed items complete
- Accuracy threshold reached (e.g., 90%)
failure_modes:
- mode: Blanking too many terms (cognitive overload)
  mitigation: 1 blank per sentence maximum; focus on highest-value terms
- mode: Using blanks that have no context clues
  mitigation: Ensure surrounding context provides retrieval cues
- mode: Rushing without committing to answers
  mitigation: Say/write answer before looking — no peeking

facilitation_prompt: 'You are running M-RET-003 (Fill-in-Blank) in RETRIEVE stage.

  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.


  Stage hard rules:

  - Require learner attempt first.

  - Do not reveal full answer before attempt.

  - Capture errors and route signals.


  Required outputs:

  - Completed cloze exercise

  - Accuracy count (correct/total blanks)

  - Miss list for targeted review

  - Second-pass improvement rate


  Stop conditions:

  - All blanks attempted

  - Second pass on missed items complete

  - Accuracy threshold reached (e.g., 90%)


  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.

  '
gating_rules:
- Require closed-note recall first, then feedback.
- If repeated misses occur, route back to ENCODE or REFERENCE.
