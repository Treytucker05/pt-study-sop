inputs:
- Single concept or topic to retrieve
- Three retrieval format prompts (free recall, application, compare/contrast)
- Reference materials for verification (closed during retrieval)
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Select one concept to practice in varied formats
  notes: Pick a concept you know reasonably well — this is for flexibility, not first learning
- step: 2
  action: 'Format 1 - Free Recall: Write everything you know about the concept'
  notes: No prompts, no structure — just dump what you remember
- step: 3
  action: 'Format 2 - Application: Answer a scenario question using the concept'
  notes: 'Example: ''Patient presents with X, how does [concept] apply?'''
- step: 4
  action: 'Format 3 - Compare/Contrast: Explain how this concept differs from a related one'
  notes: Discrimination builds stronger memory traces
- step: 5
  action: Review and verify all three outputs against source materials
  notes: Check for accuracy and completeness in each format
- step: 6
  action: Note which format was hardest — that's where your weakness is
  notes: Format difficulty reveals retrieval flexibility gaps
outputs:
- Three retrieval outputs (free recall, application, compare/contrast)
- Accuracy assessment for each format
- Difficulty ranking of formats
- Flexibility gap identification
stop_criteria:
- All three formats completed
- Verification against source complete
- Format difficulty pattern noted
failure_modes:
- mode: Rushing through formats without genuine retrieval effort
  mitigation: Treat each format as a separate mini-test — commit before checking
- mode: Picking a concept you don't know well enough yet
  mitigation: Variable retrieval is for flexibility — use on already-encoded material
- mode: Skipping the compare/contrast format
  mitigation: Compare/contrast is often hardest — don't skip it

  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.


  Stage hard rules:

  - Require learner attempt first.

  - Do not reveal full answer before attempt.

  - Capture errors and route signals.


  Required outputs:

  - Three retrieval outputs (free recall, application, compare/contrast)

  - Accuracy assessment for each format

  - Difficulty ranking of formats

  - Flexibility gap identification


  Stop conditions:

  - All three formats completed

  - Verification against source complete

  - Format difficulty pattern noted


  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.

  '
gating_rules:
- Require closed-note recall first, then feedback.
- If repeated misses occur, route back to ENCODE or REFERENCE.
