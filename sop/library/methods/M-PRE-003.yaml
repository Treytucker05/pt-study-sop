description: Conditional PRIME method that maps known concepts to the new topic when prior notes or North Star context already exist.
default_duration_min: 3
energy_cost: low
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: PRIME
status: validated
tags:
  - schema-activation
  - connections
  - transfer
mechanisms:
  - retrieval
  - elaboration
  - transfer
stipulations:
  - Run only when prior context exists (North Star and/or prior notes linked to the current learning objective).
  - If no prior context exists, skip this method and route to M-PRE-010 followed by M-PRE-008.
  - PRIME boundary: orientation only; no scored probes and no answer-checking.
  - Use this for connection mapping, not for calibration.
inputs:
  - New topic name
  - Access to previous module/course notes (required)
  - North Star objective context (preferred)
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Write the new topic at center of page
    notes: This becomes the hub for connection mapping
  - step: 2
    action: List 3-5 related concepts you already know
    notes: These can be from this course, other courses, or general knowledge
  - step: 3
    action: Draw arrows showing how each relates to the new topic
    notes: "Label arrows with relationship type: 'causes', 'part of', 'similar to'"
  - step: 4
    action: Identify the strongest connection
    notes: This becomes your primary anchoring schema
  - step: 5
    action: Note any prerequisite gaps
    notes: If a connection feels weak, flag it for review
outputs:
  - Connection map (topic + related concepts)
  - Primary anchoring schema identified
  - Prerequisite gap list
  - Optional follow_up_targets list for unresolved prerequisite gaps
stop_criteria:
  - At least 1 prior context source referenced
  - 3-5 connections identified
  - Primary anchor selected
  - 3 minutes elapsed
failure_modes:
  - mode: No prior context available
    mitigation: Skip M-PRE-003 and run M-PRE-010 then M-PRE-008
  - mode: No connections found
    mitigation: Prompt with broader categories — anatomy, physiology, pathology
  - mode: Connections too superficial
    mitigation: Require relationship labels on arrows
  - mode: Spending too long on drawing
    mitigation: Text list is acceptable; visual is optional enhancement

  You are running this method card in its assigned control stage. Execute only what this card defines.

  Operational instructions:
  1) Confirm required inputs from the card before starting. If inputs are missing, request only the minimum missing input.
  2) Follow the listed steps in order and keep output concise, structured, and actionable.
  3) Enforce control-stage boundaries:
     - PRIME: orientation and structure only; no scored checks or hidden calibration.
     - CALIBRATE: measure current state with confidence + performance signals.
     - ENCODE: force active processing; avoid passive lecture-only output.
     - REFERENCE: build concrete anchors/artifacts before any retrieval demand.
     - RETRIEVE: require learner attempt before revealing full answers.
     - OVERLEARN: run bounded fluency reps and stop at fatigue/cap criteria.
  4) Produce the outputs/artifacts listed on this card.
  5) Stop when stop_criteria are met and log required telemetry fields.
