category: prime
description: Conditional PRIME method that maps known concepts to the new topic when prior notes or North Star context already
  exist.
default_duration_min: 3
energy_cost: low
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: PRIME
status: validated
tags:
- schema-activation
- connections
- transfer
mechanisms:
- retrieval
- elaboration
- transfer
stipulations:
- Run only when prior context exists (North Star and/or prior notes linked to the current learning objective).
- If no prior context exists, skip this method and route to M-PRE-010 followed by M-PRE-008.
- PRIME boundary: orientation only; no scored probes and no answer-checking.
- Use this for connection mapping, not for calibration.
knobs:
  priming_scope: single_focus
  guidance_level: medium
constraints:
  non_assessment: true
  no_scored_checks: true
  no_retrieval_grading: true
inputs:
- New topic name
- Access to previous module/course notes (required)
- North Star objective context (preferred)
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Write the new topic at center of page
  notes: This becomes the hub for connection mapping
- step: 2
  action: List 3-5 related concepts you already know
  notes: These can be from this course, other courses, or general knowledge
- step: 3
  action: Draw arrows showing how each relates to the new topic
  notes: 'Label arrows with relationship type: ''causes'', ''part of'', ''similar to'''
- step: 4
  action: Identify the strongest connection
  notes: This becomes your primary anchoring schema
- step: 5
  action: Note any prerequisite gaps
  notes: If a connection feels weak, flag it for review
outputs:
- Connection map (topic + related concepts)
- Primary anchoring schema identified
- Prerequisite gap list
- Optional follow_up_targets list for unresolved prerequisite gaps
stop_criteria:
- At least 1 prior context source referenced
- 3-5 connections identified
- Primary anchor selected
- 3 minutes elapsed
failure_modes:
- mode: No prior context available
  mitigation: Skip M-PRE-003 and run M-PRE-010 then M-PRE-008
- mode: No connections found
  mitigation: Prompt with broader categories - anatomy, physiology, pathology
- mode: Connections too superficial
  mitigation: Require relationship labels on arrows
- mode: Spending too long on drawing
  mitigation: Text list is acceptable; visual is optional enhancement

evidence_raw: Ausubel (1968); meaningful learning requires anchoring to existing schemas
facilitation_prompt: 'You are running M-PRE-003 (Prior Knowledge Scan) in PRIME stage.

  This method is conditional and non-assessment.


  Hard rules:

  - Run only if prior notes/North Star context exist.

  - If no prior context exists, skip and route to M-PRE-010 then M-PRE-008.

  - Do not score or confidence-rate responses.


  Produce exactly:

  1) ConnectionMap (topic -> known related concepts with labeled links)

  2) PrimaryAnchor

  3) PrerequisiteGaps

  4) FollowUpTargets


  Keep to top-level orientation output; no deep teaching in this method.

  '
gating_rules:
- Do not assess or score the learner in PRIME.
- Stay at orientation level and avoid full solution reveal.
