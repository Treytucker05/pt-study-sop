description: List related concepts you already know. Identify connections to previous modules.
default_duration_min: 3
energy_cost: low
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: PRIME
status: validated
tags:
  - schema-activation
  - connections
  - transfer
mechanisms:
  - retrieval
  - elaboration
  - transfer
inputs:
  - New topic name
  - Access to previous module/course notes (optional)
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Write the new topic at center of page
    notes: This becomes the hub for connection mapping
  - step: 2
    action: List 3-5 related concepts you already know
    notes: These can be from this course, other courses, or general knowledge
  - step: 3
    action: Draw arrows showing how each relates to the new topic
    notes: "Label arrows with relationship type: 'causes', 'part of', 'similar to'"
  - step: 4
    action: Identify the strongest connection
    notes: This becomes your primary anchoring schema
  - step: 5
    action: Note any prerequisite gaps
    notes: If a connection feels weak, flag it for review
outputs:
  - Connection map (topic + related concepts)
  - Primary anchoring schema identified
  - Prerequisite gap list
stop_criteria:
  - 3-5 connections identified
  - Primary anchor selected
  - 3 minutes elapsed
failure_modes:
  - mode: No connections found
    mitigation: Prompt with broader categories — anatomy, physiology, pathology
  - mode: Connections too superficial
    mitigation: Require relationship labels on arrows
  - mode: Spending too long on drawing
    mitigation: Text list is acceptable; visual is optional enhancement
logging_fields:
  - connection_count
  - primary_anchor_topic
  - prerequisite_gaps
