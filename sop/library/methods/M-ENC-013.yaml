name: Memory Palace
category: encode
description: Use spatial memory to encode ordered sequences by associating items with familiar locations. Based on the ancient Method of Loci used by Greek orators and memory champions.

tags:

mechanisms:
  - dual_coding
  - elaboration
  - visualization
  - generation
inputs:
  - List of items to memorize (5-10 optimal)
  - Familiar location (home, route, etc.)
  - Imagination for vivid imagery
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Choose a familiar location
    notes: Must be deeply familiar (your home, daily route)
  - step: 2
    action: Identify 5-10 specific spots in order
    notes: Door, couch, kitchen sink, bed, etc.
  - step: 3
    action: Create vivid absurd image for item 1
    notes: Exaggerated, emotional, bizarre
  - step: 4
    action: Place image at location 1
    notes: Mentally "stick" it there
  - step: 5
    action: Continue for all items
    notes: One item per location
  - step: 6
    action: Walk through palace mentally
    notes: Retrieve items in order
outputs:
  - Mental palace with placed items
  - Retrieval accuracy check
  - Weak links identified
stop_criteria:
  - All items placed
  - Can retrieve forward and backward
  - Mental walk completed without errors
failure_modes:
  - mode: Locations not familiar
    mitigation: Use your actual home, not imagined places
  - mode: Images not vivid/absurd
    mitigation: Add action, emotion, exaggeration
  - mode: Too many items
    mitigation: Max 10 per palace; create new palace for more
