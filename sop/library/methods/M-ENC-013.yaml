id: M-ENC-013
name: Memory Palace
category: encode
description: Use spatial memory to encode ordered sequences by associating items with familiar locations. Based on the ancient Method of Loci used by Greek orators and memory champions.
default_duration_min: 10
energy_cost: high
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: ENCODE
status: validated
tags:
  - memory
  - spatial
  - sequence
  - visualization
  - kwik-inspired
mechanisms:
  - dual_coding
  - elaboration
  - visualization
  - generation
inputs:
  - List of items to memorize (5-10 optimal)
  - Familiar location (home, route, etc.)
  - Imagination for vivid imagery
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Choose a familiar location
    notes: Must be deeply familiar (your home, daily route)
  - step: 2
    action: Identify 5-10 specific spots in order
    notes: Door, couch, kitchen sink, bed, etc.
  - step: 3
    action: Create vivid absurd image for item 1
    notes: Exaggerated, emotional, bizarre
  - step: 4
    action: Place image at location 1
    notes: Mentally "stick" it there
  - step: 5
    action: Continue for all items
    notes: One item per location
  - step: 6
    action: Walk through palace mentally
    notes: Retrieve items in order
outputs:
  - Mental palace with placed items
  - Retrieval accuracy check
  - Weak links identified
stop_criteria:
  - All items placed
  - Can retrieve forward and backward
  - Mental walk completed without errors
failure_modes:
  - mode: Locations not familiar
    mitigation: Use your actual home, not imagined places
  - mode: Images not vivid/absurd
    mitigation: Add action, emotion, exaggeration
  - mode: Too many items
    mitigation: Max 10 per palace; create new palace for more

  You are running this method card in its assigned control stage. Execute only what this card defines.

  Operational instructions:
  1) Confirm required inputs from the card before starting. If inputs are missing, request only the minimum missing input.
  2) Follow the listed steps in order and keep output concise, structured, and actionable.
  3) Enforce control-stage boundaries:
     - PRIME: orientation and structure only; no scored checks or hidden calibration.
     - CALIBRATE: measure current state with confidence + performance signals.
     - ENCODE: force active processing; avoid passive lecture-only output.
     - REFERENCE: build concrete anchors/artifacts before any retrieval demand.
     - RETRIEVE: require learner attempt before revealing full answers.
     - OVERLEARN: run bounded fluency reps and stop at fatigue/cap criteria.
  4) Produce the outputs/artifacts listed on this card.
  5) Stop when stop_criteria are met and log required telemetry fields.
