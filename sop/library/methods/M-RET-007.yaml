description: Execute timed retrieval sprints and record latency per item to expose speed bottlenecks.
default_duration_min: 8
energy_cost: high
best_stage: review
status: draft
tags:
  - retrieval
  - timing
  - latency
mechanisms:
  - retrieval
  - desirable_difficulty
inputs:
  - Question Bank Seed
  - Timer
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Run short timed sets with strict item clocks
    notes: Mark misses at >45s and move on
  - step: 2
    action: Record time_to_answer for each item
    notes: Capture accuracy and confidence together
  - step: 3
    action: Push misses to ErrorLog.csv
    notes: Tag Speed when latency is the limiting factor
outputs:
  - Timed sprint result set
  - Latency log
  - ErrorLog updates
stop_criteria:
  - Item-level latency captured
  - Misses and speed failures logged
evidence:
  citation: Cepeda et al. (2006)
  finding: Spaced retrieval with repeated timed attempts improves long-term access speed
  source: control-plane migration
evidence_raw: Cepeda et al. (2006); repeated retrieval improves recall and response fluency
