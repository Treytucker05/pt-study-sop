mechanisms:
  - retrieval
  - desirable_difficulty
inputs:
  - Question Bank Seed
  - Timer
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Run short timed sets with strict item clocks
    notes: Mark misses at >45s and move on
  - step: 2
    action: Record time_to_answer for each item
    notes: Capture accuracy and confidence together
  - step: 3
    action: Push misses to ErrorLog.csv
    notes: Tag Speed when latency is the limiting factor
outputs:
  - Timed sprint result set
  - Latency log
  - ErrorLog updates
stop_criteria:
  - Item-level latency captured
  - Misses and speed failures logged

  finding: Spaced retrieval with repeated timed attempts improves long-term access speed
  source: control-plane migration
evidence_raw: Cepeda et al. (2006); repeated retrieval improves recall and response fluency

  You are running this method card in its assigned control stage. Execute only what this card defines.

  Operational instructions:
  1) Confirm required inputs from the card before starting. If inputs are missing, request only the minimum missing input.
  2) Follow the listed steps in order and keep output concise, structured, and actionable.
  3) Enforce control-stage boundaries:
     - PRIME: orientation and structure only; no scored checks or hidden calibration.
     - CALIBRATE: measure current state with confidence + performance signals.
     - ENCODE: force active processing; avoid passive lecture-only output.
     - REFERENCE: build concrete anchors/artifacts before any retrieval demand.
     - RETRIEVE: require learner attempt before revealing full answers.
     - OVERLEARN: run bounded fluency reps and stop at fatigue/cap criteria.
  4) Produce the outputs/artifacts listed on this card.
  5) Stop when stop_criteria are met and log required telemetry fields.
