inputs:
- Question Bank Seed
- Timer
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Run short timed sets with strict item clocks
  notes: Mark misses at >45s and move on
- step: 2
  action: Record time_to_answer for each item
  notes: Capture accuracy and confidence together
- step: 3
  action: Push misses to ErrorLog.csv
  notes: Tag Speed when latency is the limiting factor
outputs:
- Timed sprint result set
- Latency log
- ErrorLog updates
stop_criteria:
- Item-level latency captured
- Misses and speed failures logged
evidence:
  citation: Cepeda et al. (2006)
  finding: Spaced retrieval with repeated timed attempts improves long-term access speed
  source: control-plane migration
evidence_raw: Cepeda et al. (2006); repeated retrieval improves recall and response fluency
facilitation_prompt: 'You are running M-RET-007 (Timed Sprint Sets) in RETRIEVE stage.

  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.


  Stage hard rules:

  - Require learner attempt first.

  - Do not reveal full answer before attempt.

  - Capture errors and route signals.


  Required outputs:

  - Timed sprint result set

  - Latency log

  - ErrorLog updates


  Stop conditions:

  - Item-level latency captured

  - Misses and speed failures logged


  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.

  '
gating_rules:
- Require closed-note recall first, then feedback.
- If repeated misses occur, route back to ENCODE or REFERENCE.
failure_modes:
- mode: Answer leakage
  mitigation: Re-enforce attempt-first then feedback.
- mode: Repeated misses
  mitigation: Route back to ENCODE with targeted scaffold.
