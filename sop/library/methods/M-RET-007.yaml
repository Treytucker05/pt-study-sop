description: Execute timed retrieval sprints and record latency per item to expose
  speed bottlenecks.

inputs:
- Question Bank Seed
- Timer
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Run short timed sets with strict item clocks
  notes: Mark misses at >45s and move on
- step: 2
  action: Record time_to_answer for each item
  notes: Capture accuracy and confidence together
- step: 3
  action: Push misses to ErrorLog.csv
  notes: Tag Speed when latency is the limiting factor
outputs:
- Timed sprint result set
- Latency log
- ErrorLog updates
stop_criteria:
- Item-level latency captured
- Misses and speed failures logged

  citation: Cepeda et al. (2006)
  finding: Spaced retrieval with repeated timed attempts improves long-term access
    speed
  source: control-plane migration
evidence_raw: Cepeda et al. (2006); repeated retrieval improves recall and response

knobs:
  scaffolding_intensity: minimal_nudges
  feedback_style: strict_gap_analysis
  output_format: json_rubric
facilitation_prompt: You are a strict examiner conducting a retrieval practice drill.
  You must operate at a minimal_nudges level. Ask the student one question at a time.
  Evaluate their answer strictly. Provide a hint based on the scaffolding level, but
  NEVER reveal the final answer. Output a hidden JSON evaluation logging 'correct'
  or 'incorrect' for the system telemetry.
