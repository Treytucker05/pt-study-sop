description: Attempt to answer questions on the topic BEFORE studying it. Getting answers wrong primes the brain to encode the correct information more deeply.
default_duration_min: 5

tags:
  - pre-testing
  - priming
  - desirable-difficulty

mechanisms:
  - retrieval
  - desirable_difficulty
  - calibration
inputs:
  - Pre-test questions (3-5 questions on upcoming topic)
  - Timer (5 min max)
  - Answer sheet (to record guesses)
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Read pre-test questions without looking at source material
    notes: Questions can come from Tutor, past exams, or learning objectives
  - step: 2
    action: Attempt to answer each question — guess if uncertain
    notes: Wrong answers are valuable; they prime encoding
  - step: 3
    action: Rate confidence for each answer (1-5)
    notes: Calibration awareness is part of the benefit
  - step: 4
    action: Do NOT check answers yet
    notes: Answers come during study; the gap creates encoding motivation
  - step: 5
    action: Keep pre-test visible during study
    notes: Check answers as you encounter them in the material
outputs:
  - Pre-test answers (with confidence ratings)
  - Encoding priming for correct answers
  - Calibration baseline
stop_criteria:
  - All questions attempted
  - Confidence rated
  - 5 minutes elapsed
failure_modes:
  - mode: Checking answers immediately
    mitigation: Delay answer checking until after encoding phase
  - mode: Refusing to guess
    mitigation: Require an answer for every question; guessing is the point
  - mode: Pre-test too hard
    mitigation: Include mix of difficulty; some should be answerable from prior knowledge

facilitation_prompt: |
  You are running M-PRE-007 (Pre-Test) in CALIBRATE stage.
  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.

  Stage hard rules:
  - Collect measurable baseline signals.
  - Capture confidence with correctness and latency.
  - Do not provide deep teaching.

  Required outputs:
  - Pre-test answers (with confidence ratings)
  - Encoding priming for correct answers
  - Calibration baseline

  Stop conditions:
  - All questions attempted
  - Confidence rated
  - 5 minutes elapsed

  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.
