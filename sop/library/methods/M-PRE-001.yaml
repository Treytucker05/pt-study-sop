id: M-PRE-001
name: Brain Dump
category: prepare
control_stage: PRIME
description: 'Rapid orientation recall over existing notes to identify strong anchors and missing nodes before deeper work.'
default_duration_min: 3
energy_cost: low
status: validated
best_stage: first_exposure
has_steps: Y
has_outputs_or_artifacts: Y
outputs_summary: Connection refresh list; known-knowns snapshot; flagged gaps
stipulations:
- Use only when prior notes or prior North Star artifacts already exist for this objective.
- Do not run for first-contact unseen content with no prior context.
- PRIME boundary applies: no scoring, no grading, no confidence judgment.
when_to_use:
- Learner is returning to a topic with existing notes.
- Tutor needs a fast re-orientation pass before ENCODE/REFERENCE.
when_not_to_use:
- Brand-new topic with no prior notes (route to M-PRE-010 then M-PRE-008).
- High-anxiety learner who reads this as a test.
knobs:
  feedback_style:
    type: enum
    options:
    - supportive_synthesis
    - strict_gap_analysis
    default: supportive_synthesis
constraints:
  prior_context_required: true
  non_assessment: true
  no_scored_checks: true
inputs:
- Topic name
- Prior notes/North Star links
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Ask for a quick 60-120 second free write of what the learner already remembers.
  notes: Orientation only; no correctness scoring.
- step: 2
  action: Extract anchor nodes that align with existing objective targets.
  notes: Keep only top-level concepts.
- step: 3
  action: Mark obvious missing nodes as follow-up anchors.
  notes: Missing nodes are routing hints, not penalties.
outputs:
- StrongConnections
- MissingNodes
- FollowUpTargets
stop_criteria:
- At least 3 anchor nodes captured
- MissingNodes recorded
- 3 minutes elapsed
failure_modes:
- mode: Learner treats it like a quiz
  mitigation: Explicitly state this is orientation, not assessment.
- mode: No prior context exists
  mitigation: Skip and route to M-PRE-010 then M-PRE-008.

facilitation_prompt: 'You are running M-PRE-001 (Brain Dump) in PRIME stage.

  This method is non-assessment.

  This is orientation only, not assessment.


  Hard rules:

  - If prior notes/North Star context are missing, do not run this method. Route to M-PRE-010 then M-PRE-008.

  - Do not score, grade, or confidence-rate the learner.


  Ask for a brief free write, then return exactly:

  1) StrongConnections (what they already linked correctly at a top level)

  2) MissingNodes (important anchors not mentioned)

  3) FollowUpTargets (wikilinks for downstream focus)


  Use {feedback_style} tone. Keep output concise and structural.

  '
gating_rules:
- Do not assess or score the learner in PRIME.
- Stay at orientation level and avoid full solution reveal.
