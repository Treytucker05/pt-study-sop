name: Brain Dump
category: prepare
description: Free-write everything you already know about the topic for 2-3 min. Surfaces
  prior knowledge and sets a baseline.
default_duration_min: 3
energy_cost: low
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: PRIME
status: validated
tags:
- warm-up
- recall
- low-stakes
- sop-core
mechanisms:
- generation
- retrieval
- calibration
inputs:
- Topic name or concept to study
- Timer (3 min recommended)
- Blank paper or text area
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Set a timer for 2-3 minutes
  notes: Strict time limit prevents overthinking
- step: 2
  action: Write continuously about everything you know on the topic
  notes: Stream of consciousness — no pausing, no editing, no looking things up
- step: 3
  action: When stuck, write "I don't know..." and continue
  notes: Identifying gaps is part of the value
- step: 4
  action: Stop when timer ends
  notes: Do not extend — the constraint is the feature
- step: 5
  action: Review what you wrote and note surprises
  notes: Often you know more (or less) than expected
outputs:
- Brain dump notes (raw text)
- Prior knowledge baseline
- Identified knowledge gaps
stop_criteria:
- Timer ends (hard stop)
- You've exhausted everything you can recall
failure_modes:
- mode: Perfectionism paralysis
  mitigation: Remind that messy is fine — this is a dump, not a draft
- mode: Going too long
  mitigation: Enforce strict timer; value is in the constraint
- mode: Looking things up mid-dump
  mitigation: Close all references before starting
logging_fields:
- brain_dump_word_count
- prior_knowledge_level

  Using a supportive_synthesis approach, help the student map their existing knowledge
  to the upcoming concept. Keep the focus at a definition level to serve as an advance
  organizer.
