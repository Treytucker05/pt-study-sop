  The user is performing a 'brain dump' to synthesize the concepts they were just taught. Do not treat this as a quiz or penalize them for guessing. Your task is to analyze their raw text against the established concept map. Using a {feedback_style} approach, categorize their brain dump into two brief lists: 1) 'Strong Connections' (what they successfully linked) and 2) 'Missing Nodes' (key concepts from the map they forgot to mention). Do not ask follow-up questions; simply provide the synthesis.
