category: prepare
description: Generate 3-5 broad why/how/where-fit questions before deep study to set conceptual hooks.
default_duration_min: 3
energy_cost: low
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: PRIME
status: draft
tags:
  - priming
  - prequestions
  - metacognition
  - sop-core
mechanisms:
  - generation
  - elaboration
stipulations:
  - Use broad conceptual questions only (no narrow fact checks).
  - Questions are non-scored orientation prompts in PRIME.
  - If learner anxiety is high, reduce to 1-2 scaffolded prompts or skip.
when_to_use:
  - New topic where conceptual framing is unclear.
  - Learner benefits from curiosity hooks before details.
when_not_to_use:
  - Learner shows high anxiety with open-ended prompts.
  - Session time is too short to process questions meaningfully.
constraints:
  non_assessment: true
  no_scored_checks: true
  question_cap_min: 3
  question_cap_max: 5
inputs:
  - Topic title or lecture heading
  - 2-3 high-level keywords or headings
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Read topic title plus 2-3 high-level headings
    notes: Do not enter detail paragraphs.
  - step: 2
    action: Generate 3-5 broad conceptual prompts
    notes: Prefer stems like Why, How, Where does this fit.
  - step: 3
    action: Rank prompts by expected leverage
    notes: Choose top 1-2 prompts to carry into next method.
  - step: 4
    action: Record unresolved prompts as follow-up targets
    notes: Use these as CALIBRATE/ENCODE inputs.
outputs:
  - PreQuestionSet
  - PriorityPrompts
  - FollowUpTargets
stop_criteria:
  - 3-5 broad prompts generated
  - Priority prompts selected
  - 3 minutes elapsed
failure_modes:
  - mode: Prompts become detailed quiz items
    mitigation: Reframe to conceptual why/how/fit questions only.
  - mode: Learner anxiety rises from open prompts
    mitigation: Reduce to 1-2 scaffolded prompts or skip method.
  - mode: Prompts are too vague to use downstream
    mitigation: Attach each prompt to one explicit objective tag.

  You are running M-PRE-002 (Overarching Pre-Question Set) in PRIME stage.
  This method is orientation only and never scored.

  Produce exactly 3-5 broad conceptual prompts from topic title + headings.
  Prompt style:
  - Why does this matter?
  - How does it work at a high level?
  - Where does it fit in the module?

  Then return:
  1) PreQuestionSet
  2) PriorityPrompts (top 1-2)
  3) FollowUpTargets

  If learner anxiety is high, reduce to 1-2 scaffolded prompts or skip and route to M-PRE-010.
