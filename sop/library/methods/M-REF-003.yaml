description: Build a single-page reference anchor containing minimal definitions, decision rules, canonical examples, near-misses,
  and traps.

knobs:
  artifact_depth: standard

constraints:
  target_artifact_required: true

inputs:
- PrioritySet
- Source-grounded notes
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Capture minimal definitions only
  notes: Keep to high-value distinctions
- step: 2
  action: Write decision rules and triggers
  notes: Focus on rapid discrimination cues
- step: 3
  action: Add 3 canonical examples and 3 near-miss examples
  notes: Include trap notes for common errors
outputs:
- One-Page Anchor
- Trap list and near-miss set
stop_criteria:
- Definitions, decision rules, examples, near-miss, traps all present
evidence:
  citation: Schmidt & Rikers (2007)
  finding: Structured scripts and discriminators improve transfer and diagnostic reasoning
  source: control-plane migration
evidence_raw: Schmidt & Rikers (2007); structured reference schemas improve clinical reasoning
facilitation_prompt: 'You are running M-REF-003 (One-Page Anchor) in REFERENCE stage.

  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.


  Stage hard rules:

  - Build concrete anchors and artifacts.

  - Map concept to applied context.

  - Do not skip artifact creation.


  Required outputs:

  - One-Page Anchor

  - Trap list and near-miss set


  Stop conditions:

  - Definitions, decision rules, examples, near-miss, traps all present


  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.

  '
gating_rules:
- Produce structured targets that RETRIEVE can directly test.
- No retrieval drills until reference targets are explicit.
failure_modes:
- mode: Artifact too vague for retrieval
  mitigation: Rewrite targets into explicit prompts/answers.
- mode: Reference bloat
  mitigation: Trim to objective-critical content only.
