name: One-Page Anchor
category: interrogate
description: Build a single-page reference anchor containing minimal definitions, decision rules, canonical examples, near-misses, and traps.
default_duration_min: 8
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: exam_prep
control_stage: REFERENCE
status: draft
artifact_type: outline
tags:
  - reference
  - anchor
  - synthesis
mechanisms:
  - elaboration
  - discrimination
inputs:
  - PrioritySet
  - Source-grounded notes
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Capture minimal definitions only
    notes: Keep to high-value distinctions
  - step: 2
    action: Write decision rules and triggers
    notes: Focus on rapid discrimination cues
  - step: 3
    action: Add 3 canonical examples and 3 near-miss examples
    notes: Include trap notes for common errors
outputs:
  - One-Page Anchor
  - Trap list and near-miss set
stop_criteria:
  - Definitions, decision rules, examples, near-miss, traps all present
evidence:
  citation: Schmidt & Rikers (2007)
  finding: Structured scripts and discriminators improve transfer and diagnostic reasoning
  source: control-plane migration
evidence_raw: Schmidt & Rikers (2007); structured reference schemas improve clinical reasoning

  You are running this method card in its assigned control stage. Execute only what this card defines.

  Operational instructions:
  1) Confirm required inputs from the card before starting. If inputs are missing, request only the minimum missing input.
  2) Follow the listed steps in order and keep output concise, structured, and actionable.
  3) Enforce control-stage boundaries:
     - PRIME: orientation and structure only; no scored checks or hidden calibration.
     - CALIBRATE: measure current state with confidence + performance signals.
     - ENCODE: force active processing; avoid passive lecture-only output.
     - REFERENCE: build concrete anchors/artifacts before any retrieval demand.
     - RETRIEVE: require learner attempt before revealing full answers.
     - OVERLEARN: run bounded fluency reps and stop at fatigue/cap criteria.
  4) Produce the outputs/artifacts listed on this card.
  5) Stop when stop_criteria are met and log required telemetry fields.
