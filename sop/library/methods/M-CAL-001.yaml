category: prepare
description: Run a short diagnostic calibration set (5-10 items in 2-5 minutes) to estimate current readiness without grading.
default_duration_min: 4
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: first_exposure
status: draft
tags:
  - calibrate
  - diagnostic
  - baseline
mechanisms:
  - calibration
  - retrieval
inputs:
  - Objective list
  - Item prompts aligned to assessment mode
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Start timer for 2-5 minutes
    notes: Hard-stop at 5 minutes
  - step: 2
    action: Attempt 5-10 short items with no hints
    notes: If any item exceeds 45 seconds, mark miss and move on
  - step: 3
    action: Mark response state as hit or miss
    notes: No grading summary beyond hit/miss
outputs:
  - CalibrateResults.csv
  - Item hit/miss baseline
stop_criteria:
  - 5-10 items attempted
  - Timer <=5 minutes

  citation: Kornell et al. (2009)
  finding: Pretesting improves subsequent encoding and reveals calibration gaps
  source: control-plane migration
evidence_raw: Kornell et al. (2009); pretesting supports later learning even with initial misses
