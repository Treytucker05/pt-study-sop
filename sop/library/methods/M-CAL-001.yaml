description: Run a short diagnostic calibration set (5-10 items in 2-5 minutes) to estimate current readiness without grading.
default_duration_min: 4
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: CALIBRATE
status: draft
tags:
  - calibrate
  - diagnostic
  - baseline
mechanisms:
  - calibration
  - retrieval
inputs:
  - Objective list
  - Item prompts aligned to assessment mode
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Start timer for 2-5 minutes
    notes: Hard-stop at 5 minutes
  - step: 2
    action: Attempt 5-10 short items with no hints
    notes: If any item exceeds 45 seconds, mark miss and move on
  - step: 3
    action: Mark response state as hit or miss
    notes: No grading summary beyond hit/miss
outputs:
  - CalibrateResults.csv
  - Item hit/miss baseline
stop_criteria:
  - 5-10 items attempted
  - Timer <=5 minutes
evidence:
  citation: Kornell et al. (2009)
  finding: Pretesting improves subsequent encoding and reveals calibration gaps
  source: control-plane migration
evidence_raw: Kornell et al. (2009); pretesting supports later learning even with initial misses

  You are running this method card in its assigned control stage. Execute only what this card defines.

  Operational instructions:
  1) Confirm required inputs from the card before starting. If inputs are missing, request only the minimum missing input.
  2) Follow the listed steps in order and keep output concise, structured, and actionable.
  3) Enforce control-stage boundaries:
     - PRIME: orientation and structure only; no scored checks or hidden calibration.
     - CALIBRATE: measure current state with confidence + performance signals.
     - ENCODE: force active processing; avoid passive lecture-only output.
     - REFERENCE: build concrete anchors/artifacts before any retrieval demand.
     - RETRIEVE: require learner attempt before revealing full answers.
     - OVERLEARN: run bounded fluency reps and stop at fatigue/cap criteria.
  4) Produce the outputs/artifacts listed on this card.
  5) Stop when stop_criteria are met and log required telemetry fields.
