name: Concept Map
category: encode
description: Build a node-and-link diagram showing relationships between concepts.
  Self-constructed maps force elaboration and reveal structural gaps. Use Mermaid
  syntax for dashboard editor.

mechanisms:
- elaboration
- dual_coding
- generation
inputs:
- Topic with multiple related concepts (5-15 nodes)
- Blank paper or Mermaid editor
- Source material for verification
steps:
- step: 1
  action: List all key concepts from the topic (nodes)
  notes: 5-15 concepts is optimal; more becomes unwieldy
- step: 2
  action: Place the central concept in the middle
  notes: This is the hub of your map
- step: 3
  action: Connect related concepts with labeled arrows
  notes: 'Labels describe relationship: ''causes'', ''is-a'', ''has-a'', ''regulates'''
- step: 4
  action: Add cross-links between non-adjacent nodes
  notes: Cross-links show deeper understanding
- step: 5
  action: Verify relationships against source
  notes: Flag any incorrect links
- step: 6
  action: Identify missing concepts and add them
  notes: Gaps in the map reveal gaps in knowledge
outputs:
- Concept map (nodes + labeled links)
- Cross-link count
- Missing concept list
- Mermaid code (if using dashboard)
stop_criteria:
- All concepts placed and connected
- Relationships labeled
- Map verified against source
failure_modes:
- mode: Unlabeled arrows
  mitigation: Require relationship type on every link
- mode: Spoke-only structure
  mitigation: Require at least 2 cross-links between peripheral nodes
- mode: Too many nodes
  mitigation: Limit to 15 nodes; chunk into sub-maps if needed
logging_fields:
- node_count
- link_count
- cross_link_count
- gaps_identified

facilitation_prompt: You are guiding the student through the encoding phase. The student
  needs to structure their knowledge. Your task is to generate a structured breakdown
  at a mechanism level. Provide scaffolding at the heavy_hints level. Output your
  response as a markdown_table.
