name: Mechanism Trace
category: encode
description: "Trace the causal mechanism step-by-step: what triggers what, and why. Build a cause→effect chain from input to output. Especially useful for pathophysiology and physiological pathways."
default_duration_min: 10
energy_cost: high
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: ENCODE
status: validated
tags:
  - causal-reasoning
  - mechanism
  - pathophysiology
  - transfer
  - clinical
mechanisms:
  - elaboration
  - transfer
  - generation
inputs:
  - Pathway or mechanism to trace
  - Source material with mechanism details
  - Flowchart template or blank paper
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify the trigger (initial cause or stimulus)
    notes: "Example: 'ACE inhibitor blocks ACE enzyme'"
  - step: 2
    action: "Ask: 'What happens next as a direct result?'"
    notes: Write the immediate downstream effect
  - step: 3
    action: Repeat step 2 until you reach the final outcome
    notes: Each step must cause the next
  - step: 4
    action: Add "because" statements at each arrow
    notes: "Why does A cause B? Fill in the mechanism."
  - step: 5
    action: Verify chain against source material
    notes: Flag any errors or gaps
  - step: 6
    action: Note branch points where mechanisms diverge
    notes: Real pathways often have multiple effects
outputs:
  - Complete mechanism chain (trigger to outcome)
  - Because statements for each step
  - Branch points identified
  - Verification status
stop_criteria:
  - Chain reaches final outcome
  - All "because" statements filled
  - Chain verified against source
failure_modes:
  - mode: Skipping intermediate steps
    mitigation: Require explicit A→B→C, not A→C
  - mode: Vague "because" statements
    mitigation: Must cite specific molecular/cellular mechanism
  - mode: Linear thinking only
    mitigation: Actively look for branch points and parallel effects

  You are running M-ENC-008 (Mechanism Trace) in ENCODE stage.
  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.

  Stage hard rules:
  - Force active learner processing.
  - Prefer transformation over passive lecture.
  - Keep focus on target concept scope.

  Required outputs:
  - Complete mechanism chain (trigger to outcome)
  - Because statements for each step
  - Branch points identified
  - Verification status

  Stop conditions:
  - Chain reaches final outcome
  - All "because" statements filled
  - Chain verified against source

  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.
