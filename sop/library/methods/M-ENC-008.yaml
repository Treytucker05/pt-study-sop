name: Mechanism Trace
category: encode
description: "Trace the causal mechanism step-by-step: what triggers what, and why. Build a cause→effect chain from input to output. Especially useful for pathophysiology and physiological pathways."
default_duration_min: 10
energy_cost: high
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: ENCODE
status: validated
tags:
  - causal-reasoning
  - mechanism
  - pathophysiology
  - transfer
  - clinical
mechanisms:
  - elaboration
  - transfer
  - generation
inputs:
  - Pathway or mechanism to trace
  - Source material with mechanism details
  - Flowchart template or blank paper
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify the trigger (initial cause or stimulus)
    notes: "Example: 'ACE inhibitor blocks ACE enzyme'"
  - step: 2
    action: "Ask: 'What happens next as a direct result?'"
    notes: Write the immediate downstream effect
  - step: 3
    action: Repeat step 2 until you reach the final outcome
    notes: Each step must cause the next
  - step: 4
    action: Add "because" statements at each arrow
    notes: "Why does A cause B? Fill in the mechanism."
  - step: 5
    action: Verify chain against source material
    notes: Flag any errors or gaps
  - step: 6
    action: Note branch points where mechanisms diverge
    notes: Real pathways often have multiple effects
outputs:
  - Complete mechanism chain (trigger to outcome)
  - Because statements for each step
  - Branch points identified
  - Verification status
stop_criteria:
  - Chain reaches final outcome
  - All "because" statements filled
  - Chain verified against source
failure_modes:
  - mode: Skipping intermediate steps
    mitigation: Require explicit A→B→C, not A→C
  - mode: Vague "because" statements
    mitigation: Must cite specific molecular/cellular mechanism
  - mode: Linear thinking only
    mitigation: Actively look for branch points and parallel effects
logging_fields:
  - mechanism_traced
  - chain_length
  - branch_points
  - verification_errors

  You are running this method card in its assigned control stage. Execute only what this card defines.

  Operational instructions:
  1) Confirm required inputs from the card before starting. If inputs are missing, request only the minimum missing input.
  2) Follow the listed steps in order and keep output concise, structured, and actionable.
  3) Enforce control-stage boundaries:
     - PRIME: orientation and structure only; no scored checks or hidden calibration.
     - CALIBRATE: measure current state with confidence + performance signals.
     - ENCODE: force active processing; avoid passive lecture-only output.
     - REFERENCE: build concrete anchors/artifacts before any retrieval demand.
     - RETRIEVE: require learner attempt before revealing full answers.
     - OVERLEARN: run bounded fluency reps and stop at fatigue/cap criteria.
  4) Produce the outputs/artifacts listed on this card.
  5) Stop when stop_criteria are met and log required telemetry fields.
