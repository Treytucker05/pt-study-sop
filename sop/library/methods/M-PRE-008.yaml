description: Extract a compact structural spine from source material before detail work. Build high-signal nodes and link
  every node to at least one objective.
default_duration_min: 5
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: PRIME
status: validated
tags:
- prime
- structure
- orientation
- schema-priming
mechanisms:
- scaffolding
- metacognitive_monitoring
when_to_use:
- Dense or complex modules where the learner needs a high-signal schema first.
- Medical/STEM/exam-prep content with many interacting concepts.
when_not_to_use:
- Very short sessions where M-PRE-010 alone is sufficient.
- Ultra-simple fact lists better handled with direct objective framing.

inputs:
- North Star objectives
- Source packet
- objective_scope (module_all | single_focus)
- focus_objective_id (required in single_focus)
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Resolve objective scope and objective set
  notes: Objective context can come from M-PRE-010 in current flow OR existing North Star from prior sessions; module_all
    uses all active module objectives; single_focus uses only the selected objective.
- step: 2
  action: Extract structural spine nodes
  notes: Keep node count <= node_cap; prefer mechanism/decision nodes over trivia.
- step: 3
  action: Link each node to objective IDs
  notes: Any unlinked node is removed when objective_link_required=true.
- step: 4
  action: Mark unknown or low-confidence nodes
  notes: Unknowns are orientation markers only; do not score or quiz.
outputs:
- StructuralSpine
- Objective linkage map
- UnknownNodeList
- PriorityNodes
stop_criteria:
- Spine node count <= node_cap
- Every node links to >=1 objective when objective_link_required=true
- UnknownNodeList is present (can be empty)
- No scored probes or retrieval grading emitted
evidence:

  finding: Advance organizers improve comprehension when structure is established before detail.

evidence_raw: Ausubel (1968); structural organizers improve meaningful learning
facilitation_prompt: 'You are running M-PRE-008 (Structural Extraction) in PRIME stage.

  This method is non-assessment: do not quiz, grade, or run retrieval checks.


  Dependency note:

  - M-PRE-008 requires objective context.

  - Objective context may come from M-PRE-010 in this flow OR an already-built North Star.

  - In PRIME for first-contact material, run M-PRE-010 before M-PRE-008. If North Star already exists, the prerequisite remains
  satisfied.


  Time guidance by priming_depth_mode:

  - basic: 2-5 minutes

  - schema: 5-10 minutes for complex topics


  Use objective_scope:

  - module_all: build a high-level spine across all active module objectives.

  - single_focus: build a spine only for the selected focus objective.


  Produce:

  1) StructuralSpine (<= node_cap, high-signal nodes only)

  2) Objective linkage map (every node linked to >=1 objective)

  3) UnknownNodeList (orientation gaps, not scores)

  4) PriorityNodes (what to cover first)


  Exclude trivia and avoid deep teaching details in this method.

  '
gating_rules:
- Do not assess or score the learner in PRIME.
- Stay at orientation level and avoid full solution reveal.
failure_modes:
- mode: Scope too broad
  mitigation: Reduce to objective-aligned scaffold and continue.
- mode: Drift into testing
  mitigation: Return to orientation-only behavior.
