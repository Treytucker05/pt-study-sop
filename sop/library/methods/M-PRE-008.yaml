description: Extract a compact structural spine from source material before detail work. Build at most 12 high-signal nodes and link each node to one objective.

mechanisms:

  - metacognitive_monitoring
inputs:
  - Topic objectives
  - Source packet
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: List objective IDs for the topic
    notes: Keep objective wording verbatim
  - step: 2
    action: Extract no more than 12 structural nodes
    notes: Prefer mechanism or decision nodes over trivia
  - step: 3
    action: Link each node to at least one objective ID
    notes: Unlinked nodes are removed
outputs:
  - Spine (<=12 nodes)
  - Objective linkage map
stop_criteria:
  - Spine has <=12 nodes
  - Every node links to >=1 objective

  finding: Advance organizers improve comprehension when structure is established before detail
  source: control-plane migration
evidence_raw: Ausubel (1968); structural organizers improve meaningful learning
