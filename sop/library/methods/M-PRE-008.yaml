  trivia_node_exclusion: true
inputs:
  - North Star objectives
  - Source packet
  - objective_scope (module_all | single_focus)
  - focus_objective_id (required in single_focus)
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Resolve objective scope and objective set
    notes: module_all uses all active module objectives; single_focus uses only the selected objective.
  - step: 2
    action: Extract structural spine nodes
    notes: Keep node count <= node_cap; prefer mechanism/decision nodes over trivia.
  - step: 3
    action: Link each node to objective IDs
    notes: Any unlinked node is removed when objective_link_required=true.
  - step: 4
    action: Mark unknown or low-confidence nodes
    notes: Unknowns are orientation markers only; do not score or quiz.
outputs:
  - StructuralSpine
  - Objective linkage map
  - UnknownNodeList
  - PriorityNodes
stop_criteria:
  - Spine node count <= node_cap
  - Every node links to >=1 objective when objective_link_required=true
  - UnknownNodeList is present (can be empty)
  - No scored probes or retrieval grading emitted
evidence:
  citation: Ausubel (1968)
  finding: Advance organizers improve comprehension when structure is established before detail
  source: control-plane migration
evidence_raw: Ausubel (1968); structural organizers improve meaningful learning

  You are running M-PRE-008 (Structural Extraction) in PRIME stage.
  This method is non-assessment: do not quiz, grade, or run retrieval checks.

  Use objective_scope:
  - module_all: build a high-level spine across all active module objectives.
  - single_focus: build a spine only for the selected focus objective.

  Produce:
  1) StructuralSpine (<= node_cap, high-signal nodes only)
  2) Objective linkage map (every node linked to >=1 objective)
  3) UnknownNodeList (orientation gaps, not scores)
  4) PriorityNodes (what to cover first)

  Exclude trivia and avoid deep teaching details in this method.
