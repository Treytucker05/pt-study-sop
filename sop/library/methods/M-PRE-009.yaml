name: Syntopical Big-Picture Synthesis
category: prime
description: Synthesize top-level structure across 2-3 sources into one module-level hierarchy with cross-links.
default_duration_min: 6
energy_cost: low
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: PRIME
status: validated
tags:
- prime
- syntopical
- synthesis
- hierarchy
mechanisms:
- schema_activation
- integration
stipulations:
- Use at most 2-3 sources to keep the synthesis bounded.
- Resolve contradictions at a top-down level; do not deep-dive details.
- PRIME boundary applies: no scored checks.
when_to_use:
- Multi-source study packets (slides + summary + glossary).
- Clinical reasoning or research-heavy topics that need integration.
when_not_to_use:
- Single-source content where cross-source synthesis adds no value.
- Time budgets below 3 minutes.
knobs:
  source_cap: 3
  synthesis_format: hierarchy
constraints:
  non_assessment: true
  source_cap_hard_lock: true
inputs:
- 2-3 source excerpts
- Learning objectives (optional)
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Extract top-level pillars from each source
  notes: Only headings and conceptual anchors.
- step: 2
  action: Merge overlapping pillars into one unified structure
  notes: Preserve source-specific distinctions where needed.
- step: 3
  action: Add cross-links and conflict notes
  notes: Mark unresolved conflicts as follow-up targets.
outputs:
- UnifiedTopDownTree
- CrossSourceLinks
- ConflictFlags
- FollowUpTargets
stop_criteria:
- Unified tree generated from all included sources
- Cross-links recorded
- Conflict flags captured
evidence:
  citation: Ausubel (1968)
  finding: Comparative organizers support integration across related sources.
  source: research synthesis
evidence_strength: medium
primary_citations:
- Ausubel (1968)
- Sung (2025)
evidence_raw: Syntopical synthesis improves macro-structure orientation when multiple sources are used.
facilitation_prompt: 'You are running M-PRE-009 (Syntopical Big-Picture Synthesis) in PRIME.

  Build one integrated top-down view from up to {source_cap} sources.


  Return exactly:

  1) UnifiedTopDownTree ({synthesis_format})

  2) CrossSourceLinks

  3) ConflictFlags

  4) FollowUpTargets


  Rules:

  - Keep synthesis high-level.

  - Non-assessment only.

  - If only one source is available, skip this method.

  '
gating_rules:
- Do not assess or score the learner in PRIME.
- Stay at orientation level and avoid full solution reveal.
failure_modes:
- mode: Scope too broad
  mitigation: Reduce to objective-aligned scaffold and continue.
- mode: Drift into testing
  mitigation: Return to orientation-only behavior.
