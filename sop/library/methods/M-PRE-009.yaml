  - goal-setting
mechanisms:
  - metacognitive_monitoring
  - calibration
inputs:
  - Objectives list
  - Upcoming assessment context
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Mark each objective as must-know or secondary
    notes: Use exam relevance and frequency
  - step: 2
    action: Record top 3 goal targets for this session
    notes: Goals must be observable
  - step: 3
    action: Capture unknowns and predictions
    notes: Unknown is allowed and expected
outputs:
  - GoalTargets
  - Unknowns
  - Predictions
stop_criteria:
  - Top 3 goals are explicit
  - Unknowns and predictions captured

  You are running this method card in its assigned control stage. Execute only what this card defines.

  Operational instructions:
  1) Confirm required inputs from the card before starting. If inputs are missing, request only the minimum missing input.
  2) Follow the listed steps in order and keep output concise, structured, and actionable.
  3) Enforce control-stage boundaries:
     - PRIME: orientation and structure only; no scored checks or hidden calibration.
     - CALIBRATE: measure current state with confidence + performance signals.
     - ENCODE: force active processing; avoid passive lecture-only output.
     - REFERENCE: build concrete anchors/artifacts before any retrieval demand.
     - RETRIEVE: require learner attempt before revealing full answers.
     - OVERLEARN: run bounded fluency reps and stop at fatigue/cap criteria.
  4) Produce the outputs/artifacts listed on this card.
  5) Stop when stop_criteria are met and log required telemetry fields.
