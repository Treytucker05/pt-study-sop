name: Cross-Topic Link
category: interrogate
description: Identify 2-3 connections between this topic and topics from other courses. Look for shared principles.
default_duration_min: 3
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: consolidation
control_stage: ENCODE
status: validated
tags:
  - integration
  - cross-course
  - big-picture
  - transfer
mechanisms:
  - elaboration
  - transfer
inputs:
  - Current topic
  - Access to previous course notes (optional)
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: State the current topic clearly
    notes: What's the core concept?
  - step: 2
    action: Brainstorm connections to other courses
    notes: "Think: anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, clinical"
  - step: 3
    action: Identify 2-3 strongest cross-topic links
    notes: "Look for: shared mechanisms, shared structures, cause-effect chains"
  - step: 4
    action: Write a sentence explaining each connection
    notes: "Format: '[Topic A] connects to [Topic B] because...'"
  - step: 5
    action: Identify the shared principle underlying the connection
    notes: What general rule applies to both?
outputs:
  - Cross-topic connection list (2-3)
  - Explanatory sentences
  - Shared principles identified
stop_criteria:
  - 2-3 connections identified
  - Each explained in one sentence
  - Shared principle stated
failure_modes:
  - mode: Connections too vague
    mitigation: Require specific shared mechanism or structure
  - mode: Only within-course connections
    mitigation: At least one must be from a different course
  - mode: Listing without explaining
    mitigation: Each connection needs a "because" statement
logging_fields:
  - topic_linked
  - cross_topics

  You are running this method card in its assigned control stage. Execute only what this card defines.

  Operational instructions:
  1) Confirm required inputs from the card before starting. If inputs are missing, request only the minimum missing input.
  2) Follow the listed steps in order and keep output concise, structured, and actionable.
  3) Enforce control-stage boundaries:
     - PRIME: orientation and structure only; no scored checks or hidden calibration.
     - CALIBRATE: measure current state with confidence + performance signals.
     - ENCODE: force active processing; avoid passive lecture-only output.
     - REFERENCE: build concrete anchors/artifacts before any retrieval demand.
     - RETRIEVE: require learner attempt before revealing full answers.
     - OVERLEARN: run bounded fluency reps and stop at fatigue/cap criteria.
  4) Produce the outputs/artifacts listed on this card.
  5) Stop when stop_criteria are met and log required telemetry fields.
