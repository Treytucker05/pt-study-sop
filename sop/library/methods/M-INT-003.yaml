id: M-INT-003
name: Cross-Topic Link
category: interrogate
description: Identify 2-3 connections between this topic and topics from other courses. Look for shared principles.
default_duration_min: 3
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: consolidation
control_stage: ENCODE
status: validated
tags:
  - integration
  - cross-course
  - big-picture
  - transfer
mechanisms:
  - elaboration
  - transfer
inputs:
  - Current topic
  - Access to previous course notes (optional)
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: State the current topic clearly
    notes: What's the core concept?
  - step: 2
    action: Brainstorm connections to other courses
    notes: "Think: anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, clinical"
  - step: 3
    action: Identify 2-3 strongest cross-topic links
    notes: "Look for: shared mechanisms, shared structures, cause-effect chains"
  - step: 4
    action: Write a sentence explaining each connection
    notes: "Format: '[Topic A] connects to [Topic B] because...'"
  - step: 5
    action: Identify the shared principle underlying the connection
    notes: What general rule applies to both?
outputs:
  - Cross-topic connection list (2-3)
  - Explanatory sentences
  - Shared principles identified
stop_criteria:
  - 2-3 connections identified
  - Each explained in one sentence
  - Shared principle stated
failure_modes:
  - mode: Connections too vague
    mitigation: Require specific shared mechanism or structure
  - mode: Only within-course connections
    mitigation: At least one must be from a different course
  - mode: Listing without explaining
    mitigation: Each connection needs a "because" statement

  You are running M-INT-003 (Cross-Topic Link) in ENCODE stage.
  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.

  Stage hard rules:
  - Force active learner processing.
  - Prefer transformation over passive lecture.
  - Keep focus on target concept scope.

  Required outputs:
  - Cross-topic connection list (2-3)
  - Explanatory sentences
  - Shared principles identified

  Stop conditions:
  - 2-3 connections identified
  - Each explained in one sentence
  - Shared principle stated

  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.
