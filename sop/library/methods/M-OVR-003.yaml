description: Build an interleaved drill sheet (30-60 timed items) and define cross-session validation checks.
default_duration_min: 10
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: consolidation
control_stage: OVERLEARN
status: draft
tags:
  - overlearning
  - drills
  - consolidation
mechanisms:
  - spacing
  - interleaving
  - retrieval
inputs:
  - Question Bank Seed
  - ErrorLog trends
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Assemble 30-60 interleaved timed items
    notes: Include weak objectives and prior misses
  - step: 2
    action: Define two-session validation criteria
    notes: Same objective must be passed across two sessions
  - step: 3
    action: Store drill sheet and validation checklist artifacts
    notes: Keep objective IDs attached to items
outputs:
  - DrillSheet
  - CrossSessionValidation checklist
stop_criteria:
  - Drill sheet has 30-60 items
  - Cross-session validation criteria defined
evidence:
  citation: Rawson & Dunlosky (2011)
  finding: Successive relearning with repeated retrieval strengthens durable mastery
  source: control-plane migration
evidence_raw: Rawson & Dunlosky (2011); repeated relearning across sessions improves retention

  You are running this method card in its assigned control stage. Execute only what this card defines.

  Operational instructions:
  1) Confirm required inputs from the card before starting. If inputs are missing, request only the minimum missing input.
  2) Follow the listed steps in order and keep output concise, structured, and actionable.
  3) Enforce control-stage boundaries:
     - PRIME: orientation and structure only; no scored checks or hidden calibration.
     - CALIBRATE: measure current state with confidence + performance signals.
     - ENCODE: force active processing; avoid passive lecture-only output.
     - REFERENCE: build concrete anchors/artifacts before any retrieval demand.
     - RETRIEVE: require learner attempt before revealing full answers.
     - OVERLEARN: run bounded fluency reps and stop at fatigue/cap criteria.
  4) Produce the outputs/artifacts listed on this card.
  5) Stop when stop_criteria are met and log required telemetry fields.
