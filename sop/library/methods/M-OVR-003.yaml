mechanisms:
  - spacing
  - interleaving
  - retrieval
inputs:
  - Question Bank Seed
  - ErrorLog trends
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Assemble 30-60 interleaved timed items
    notes: Include weak objectives and prior misses
  - step: 2
    action: Define two-session validation criteria
    notes: Same objective must be passed across two sessions
  - step: 3
    action: Store drill sheet and validation checklist artifacts
    notes: Keep objective IDs attached to items
outputs:
  - DrillSheet
  - CrossSessionValidation checklist
stop_criteria:
  - Drill sheet has 30-60 items
  - Cross-session validation criteria defined
evidence:
  citation: Rawson & Dunlosky (2011)
  finding: Successive relearning with repeated retrieval strengthens durable mastery
  source: control-plane migration
evidence_raw: Rawson & Dunlosky (2011); repeated relearning across sessions improves retention

  You are running M-OVR-003 (Drill Sheet Builder) in OVERLEARN stage.
  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.

  Stage hard rules:
  - Run bounded fluency reps.
  - Respect fatigue and stop caps.
  - Prioritize durable retention over speed only.

  Required outputs:
  - DrillSheet
  - CrossSessionValidation checklist

  Stop conditions:
  - Drill sheet has 30-60 items
  - Cross-session validation criteria defined

  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.
