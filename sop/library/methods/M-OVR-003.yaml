inputs:
- Question Bank Seed
- ErrorLog trends
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Assemble 30-60 interleaved timed items
  notes: Include weak objectives and prior misses
- step: 2
  action: Define two-session validation criteria
  notes: Same objective must be passed across two sessions
- step: 3
  action: Store drill sheet and validation checklist artifacts
  notes: Keep objective IDs attached to items
outputs:
- DrillSheet
- CrossSessionValidation checklist
stop_criteria:
- Drill sheet has 30-60 items
- Cross-session validation criteria defined

knobs:
  scaffolding_intensity: minimal_nudges
  feedback_style: strict_gap_analysis
  output_format: json_rubric
facilitation_prompt: You are a strict examiner conducting a retrieval practice drill.
  You must operate at a minimal_nudges level. Ask the student one question at a time.
  Evaluate their answer strictly. Provide a hint based on the scaffolding level, but
  NEVER reveal the final answer. Output a hidden JSON evaluation logging 'correct'
  or 'incorrect' for the system telemetry.
