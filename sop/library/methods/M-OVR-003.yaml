steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Assemble 30-60 interleaved timed items
    notes: Include weak objectives and prior misses
  - step: 2
    action: Define two-session validation criteria
    notes: Same objective must be passed across two sessions
  - step: 3
    action: Store drill sheet and validation checklist artifacts
    notes: Keep objective IDs attached to items
