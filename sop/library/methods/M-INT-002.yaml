status: validated
tags:
  - clinical
  - application
  - pt-specific
  - sop-core
mechanisms:
  - transfer
  - elaboration
  - generation
inputs:
  - Concept to apply clinically
  - Clinical scenario or patient type
  - Source material for verification
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: State the concept and choose a patient population
    notes: "Example: 'ACE inhibitors in a 65yo with CHF and diabetes'"
  - step: 2
    action: "Ask: How would dysfunction/pathology present?"
    notes: What symptoms and signs would you see?
  - step: 3
    action: "Ask: What would you test or assess?"
    notes: Physical exam findings, lab tests, imaging
  - step: 4
    action: "Ask: How would you intervene?"
    notes: Treatment, precautions, patient education
  - step: 5
    action: Verify your clinical reasoning against source
    notes: Flag any errors or gaps
outputs:
  - Clinical application narrative
  - Presentation, testing, intervention summary
  - Verification notes
stop_criteria:
  - All three questions answered (present, test, treat)
  - Verified against source
  - 5 minutes elapsed
failure_modes:
  - mode: Generic application
    mitigation: Require specific patient characteristics
  - mode: Skipping assessment phase
    mitigation: Must include at least 2 tests/assessments
  - mode: Treatment without rationale
    mitigation: Explain WHY this treatment for this patient

  You are running this method card in its assigned control stage. Execute only what this card defines.

  Operational instructions:
  1) Confirm required inputs from the card before starting. If inputs are missing, request only the minimum missing input.
  2) Follow the listed steps in order and keep output concise, structured, and actionable.
  3) Enforce control-stage boundaries:
     - PRIME: orientation and structure only; no scored checks or hidden calibration.
     - CALIBRATE: measure current state with confidence + performance signals.
     - ENCODE: force active processing; avoid passive lecture-only output.
     - REFERENCE: build concrete anchors/artifacts before any retrieval demand.
     - RETRIEVE: require learner attempt before revealing full answers.
     - OVERLEARN: run bounded fluency reps and stop at fatigue/cap criteria.
  4) Produce the outputs/artifacts listed on this card.
  5) Stop when stop_criteria are met and log required telemetry fields.
