inputs:
- Concept to apply clinically
- Clinical scenario or patient type
- Source material for verification
steps:
- step: 1
  action: State the concept and choose a patient population
  notes: 'Example: ''ACE inhibitors in a 65yo with CHF and diabetes'''
- step: 2
  action: 'Ask: How would dysfunction/pathology present?'
  notes: What symptoms and signs would you see?
- step: 3
  action: 'Ask: What would you test or assess?'
  notes: Physical exam findings, lab tests, imaging
- step: 4
  action: 'Ask: How would you intervene?'
  notes: Treatment, precautions, patient education
- step: 5
  action: Verify your clinical reasoning against source
  notes: Flag any errors or gaps
outputs:
- Clinical application narrative
- Presentation, testing, intervention summary
- Verification notes
stop_criteria:
- All three questions answered (present, test, treat)
- Verified against source
- 5 minutes elapsed
failure_modes:
- mode: Generic application
  mitigation: Require specific patient characteristics
- mode: Skipping assessment phase
  mitigation: Must include at least 2 tests/assessments
- mode: Treatment without rationale
  mitigation: Explain WHY this treatment for this patient

facilitation_prompt: 'You are running M-INT-002 (Clinical Application) in ENCODE stage.

  The learner must actively transform the concept into a clinical scenario.

  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.


  Stage hard rules:

  - Require learner attempt first.

  - Do not reveal full answer before attempt.

  - Capture errors and route signals.


  Required outputs:

  - Clinical application narrative

  - Presentation, testing, intervention summary

  - Verification notes


  Stop conditions:

  - All three questions answered (present, test, treat)

  - Verified against source

  - 5 minutes elapsed


  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.

  '
gating_rules:
- Require closed-note recall first, then feedback.
- If repeated misses occur, route back to ENCODE or REFERENCE.
