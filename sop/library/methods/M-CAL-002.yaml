name: Confidence Tagging
category: prepare
description: Add confidence tags (H/M/L) for each calibrate item to separate knowledge gaps from confidence miscalibration.
default_duration_min: 3
energy_cost: low
best_stage: first_exposure
control_stage: CALIBRATE
status: draft
tags:
  - calibrate
  - confidence
  - metacognition
mechanisms:
  - metacognitive_monitoring
  - calibration
inputs:
  - Calibrate item responses
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Tag each item as H, M, or L confidence
    notes: Tag before reviewing correctness
  - step: 2
    action: Flag high-confidence misses
    notes: These become top priority for ENCODE
  - step: 3
    action: Record confidence with response latency
    notes: Keep item-level detail
outputs:
  - Confidence-tagged calibrate set
  - High-confidence miss list
stop_criteria:
  - Every calibrate item has an H/M/L tag
evidence:
  citation: Metcalfe (2017)
  finding: Confidence monitoring improves targeting of corrective study actions
  source: control-plane migration
evidence_raw: Metcalfe (2017); metacognitive calibration improves error correction

  You are running this method card in its assigned control stage. Execute only what this card defines.

  Operational instructions:
  1) Confirm required inputs from the card before starting. If inputs are missing, request only the minimum missing input.
  2) Follow the listed steps in order and keep output concise, structured, and actionable.
  3) Enforce control-stage boundaries:
     - PRIME: orientation and structure only; no scored checks or hidden calibration.
     - CALIBRATE: measure current state with confidence + performance signals.
     - ENCODE: force active processing; avoid passive lecture-only output.
     - REFERENCE: build concrete anchors/artifacts before any retrieval demand.
     - RETRIEVE: require learner attempt before revealing full answers.
     - OVERLEARN: run bounded fluency reps and stop at fatigue/cap criteria.
  4) Produce the outputs/artifacts listed on this card.
  5) Stop when stop_criteria are met and log required telemetry fields.
