tags:
  - clinical
  - case-based
  - reasoning
  - application
mechanisms:
  - transfer
  - elaboration
  - generation
inputs:
  - Clinical case (real or constructed)
  - Concepts to apply
  - Source material for verification
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Read the case presentation (chief complaint, history)
    notes: Note key features that narrow the differential
  - step: 2
    action: Generate a differential diagnosis (3-5 possibilities)
    notes: Most likely to least likely
  - step: 3
    action: Identify key assessments to distinguish diagnoses
    notes: What tests or exams would help?
  - step: 4
    action: Walk through the reasoning for each step
    notes: "Why this test? What would positive/negative mean?"
  - step: 5
    action: Reach a diagnosis and plan intervention
    notes: Connect back to learned concepts
  - step: 6
    action: Verify reasoning against case key/source
    notes: Flag reasoning errors
outputs:
  - Case walkthrough narrative
  - Differential diagnosis list
  - Assessment plan
  - Intervention plan
  - Reasoning verification
stop_criteria:
  - Case fully walked through (presentation to intervention)
  - Reasoning documented
  - Verified against source
failure_modes:
  - mode: Jumping to diagnosis too fast
    mitigation: Require explicit differential before diagnosis
  - mode: Skipping assessment rationale
    mitigation: Every test needs a "because I want to rule in/out..."
  - mode: Not connecting to concepts studied
    mitigation: Explicitly name which concepts the case applies
