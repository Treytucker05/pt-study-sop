id: M-INT-005
name: Case Walkthrough
category: interrogate
control_stage: ENCODE
description: Walk through a realistic case to retrieve reasoning steps, identify gaps, and reinforce application accuracy.
default_duration_min: 10
energy_cost: high
has_steps: Y
has_outputs_or_artifacts: Y
outputs_summary: Case walkthrough narrative; Assessment plan; Reasoning verification
knobs:
  guidance_level: partial_scaffold
facilitation_prompt: 'You are running M-INT-005 (Case Walkthrough) in ENCODE stage.

  The learner must actively transform clinical knowledge into case-based reasoning.

  Require an attempt-first case response before feedback.

  Use {guidance_level}: - case_prompt_only: present the case and require full learner reasoning. - partial_scaffold: allow
  limited structure prompts without revealing final answer. - targeted_hint: provide one focused hint after an attempt, then
  require revised answer.

  Return: 1) LearnerCaseResponse 2) ErrorTags 3) ConfidenceTag 4) CorrectiveFeedback 5) NextTargetedProbe

constraints:
  attempt_required_before_feedback: true
  closed_note_first: true
  route_back_on_repeated_miss: true
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Start RETRIEVE protocol within scope
  notes: Respect stage boundaries.
- step: 2
  action: Execute method actions in order
  notes: Capture required telemetry/artifacts.
- step: 3
  action: Emit required outputs and handoff
  notes: Do not drift into another stage.
inputs:
- Reference targets or question bank
- Scoring rubric and confidence capture
gating_rules:
- Require closed-note recall first, then feedback.
- If repeated misses occur, route back to ENCODE or REFERENCE.
outputs:
- LearnerCaseResponse
- ErrorTags
- ConfidenceTag
- CorrectiveFeedback
- NextTargetedProbe
stop_criteria:
- Attempt-first response completed
- Corrective feedback delivered
- Next targeted probe produced
failure_modes:
- mode: Answer leakage
  mitigation: Re-enforce attempt-first then feedback.
- mode: Repeated misses
  mitigation: Route back to ENCODE with targeted scaffold.
artifact_type: notes
evidence_raw: Schmidt & Rikers (2007); case-based walkthrough strengthens illness script formation and transfer
