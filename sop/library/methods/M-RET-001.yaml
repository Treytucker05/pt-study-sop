name: Free Recall Blurt
category: retrieve
description: Close materials. Write everything you remember about the topic. No peeking.
  Compare after.
default_duration_min: 5
energy_cost: medium
best_stage: review
control_stage: RETRIEVE
status: validated
tags:
- recall
- testing-effect
- self-assessment
mechanisms:
- retrieval
- generation
- calibration
inputs:
- Topic or concept to recall
- Blank paper or text area
- Timer (5 min recommended)
- Reference materials (closed during recall, opened for comparison)
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Close all materials and reference sources
  notes: Materials must be completely hidden — no peeking allowed
- step: 2
  action: Set timer for 5 minutes
  notes: Time pressure adds desirable difficulty
- step: 3
  action: Write everything you remember about the topic
  notes: Stream of consciousness — include facts, relationships, examples, anything
- step: 4
  action: When stuck, write "?" and move to next thing you remember
  notes: Gaps are valuable data — mark them explicitly
- step: 5
  action: Stop when timer ends or you've exhausted recall
  notes: Don't extend time — constraint is the feature
- step: 6
  action: Open materials and compare your output to the source
  notes: Mark correct items, identify missing items, note errors
outputs:
- Free recall dump (raw text with gaps marked)
- Accuracy assessment (what was correct vs. incorrect)
- Gap list (what was missing)
- RSR percentage estimate
stop_criteria:
- Timer ends (hard stop)
- You've exhausted everything you can recall
- Comparison with source is complete
failure_modes:
- mode: Peeking during recall
  mitigation: Physically move materials out of sight before starting
- mode: Stopping too early when recall feels hard
  mitigation: Push through the difficulty — that's where learning happens
- mode: Skipping the comparison step
  mitigation: Comparison is mandatory — it's where you learn what you missed

facilitation_prompt: You are a strict examiner conducting a retrieval practice drill.
  You must operate at a minimal_nudges level. Ask the student one question at a time.
  Evaluate their answer strictly. Provide a hint based on the scaffolding level, but
  NEVER reveal the final answer. Output a hidden JSON evaluation logging 'correct'
  or 'incorrect' for the system telemetry.
