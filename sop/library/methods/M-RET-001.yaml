inputs:
- Topic or concept to recall
- Blank paper or text area
- Timer (5 min recommended)
- Reference materials (closed during recall, opened for comparison)
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Close all materials and reference sources
  notes: Materials must be completely hidden — no peeking allowed
- step: 2
  action: Set timer for 5 minutes
  notes: Time pressure adds desirable difficulty
- step: 3
  action: Write everything you remember about the topic
  notes: Stream of consciousness — include facts, relationships, examples, anything
- step: 4
  action: When stuck, write "?" and move to next thing you remember
  notes: Gaps are valuable data — mark them explicitly
- step: 5
  action: Stop when timer ends or you've exhausted recall
  notes: Don't extend time — constraint is the feature
- step: 6
  action: Open materials and compare your output to the source
  notes: Mark correct items, identify missing items, note errors
outputs:
- Free recall dump (raw text with gaps marked)
- Accuracy assessment (what was correct vs. incorrect)
- Gap list (what was missing)
- RSR percentage estimate
stop_criteria:
- Timer ends (hard stop)
- You've exhausted everything you can recall
- Comparison with source is complete
failure_modes:
- mode: Peeking during recall
  mitigation: Physically move materials out of sight before starting
- mode: Stopping too early when recall feels hard
  mitigation: Push through the difficulty — that's where learning happens
- mode: Skipping the comparison step
  mitigation: Comparison is mandatory — it's where you learn what you missed

facilitation_prompt: 'You are running M-RET-001 (Free Recall Blurt) in RETRIEVE stage.

  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.


  Stage hard rules:

  - Require learner attempt first.

  - Do not reveal full answer before attempt.

  - Capture errors and route signals.


  Required outputs:

  - Free recall dump (raw text with gaps marked)

  - Accuracy assessment (what was correct vs. incorrect)

  - Gap list (what was missing)

  - RSR percentage estimate


  Stop conditions:

  - Timer ends (hard stop)

  - You''ve exhausted everything you can recall

  - Comparison with source is complete


  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.

  '
gating_rules:
- Require closed-note recall first, then feedback.
- If repeated misses occur, route back to ENCODE or REFERENCE.
