category: retrieve
description: Run near-miss adversarial prompts that force distinction between confusable concepts under low support.
default_duration_min: 8
energy_cost: high
best_stage: exam_prep
control_stage: RETRIEVE
status: validated
tags:
  - retrieval
  - adversarial
  - confusables
mechanisms:
  - discrimination
  - retrieval
inputs:
  - Confusable pairs from Spine or ErrorLog
  - Question Bank Seed
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Select confusable pairs with highest error risk
    notes: Use recent Confusion errors first
  - step: 2
    action: Ask near-miss prompts with minimal cues
    notes: Require explicit discriminator in each response
  - step: 3
    action: Log misses to ErrorLog.csv
    notes: Include error_type and fix_applied
outputs:
  - Adversarial near-miss results
  - ErrorLog updates
stop_criteria:
  - Near-miss set completed
  - All misses logged
evidence:
  citation: Rohrer et al. (2015)
  finding: Interleaved discrimination practice improves transfer on confusable categories
  source: control-plane migration
evidence_raw: Rohrer et al. (2015); discrimination practice strengthens near-miss recognition

  You are running M-RET-006 (Adversarial Drill) in RETRIEVE stage.
  Execute this method card exactly and keep outputs deterministic.

  Stage hard rules:
  - Require learner attempt first.
  - Do not reveal full answer before attempt.
  - Capture errors and route signals.

  Required outputs:
  - Adversarial near-miss results
  - ErrorLog updates

  Stop conditions:
  - Near-miss set completed
  - All misses logged

  If required inputs are missing, request only the minimum needed input and continue.
