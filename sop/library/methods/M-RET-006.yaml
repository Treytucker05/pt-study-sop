description: Run near-miss adversarial prompts that force distinction between confusable
  concepts under low support.
default_duration_min: 8
energy_cost: high
best_stage: exam_prep
control_stage: RETRIEVE
status: draft
tags:
- retrieval
- adversarial
- confusables
mechanisms:
- discrimination
- retrieval
inputs:
- Confusable pairs from Spine or ErrorLog
- Question Bank Seed
steps:
- step: 1
  action: Select confusable pairs with highest error risk
  notes: Use recent Confusion errors first
- step: 2
  action: Ask near-miss prompts with minimal cues
  notes: Require explicit discriminator in each response
- step: 3
  action: Log misses to ErrorLog.csv
  notes: Include error_type and fix_applied
outputs:
- Adversarial near-miss results
- ErrorLog updates
stop_criteria:
- Near-miss set completed
- All misses logged

  citation: Rohrer et al. (2015)
  finding: Interleaved discrimination practice improves transfer on confusable categories
  source: control-plane migration
evidence_raw: Rohrer et al. (2015); discrimination practice strengthens near-miss
  recognition

  feedback_style: strict_gap_analysis
  output_format: json_rubric
facilitation_prompt: You are a strict examiner conducting a retrieval practice drill.
  You must operate at a minimal_nudges level. Ask the student one question at a time.
  Evaluate their answer strictly. Provide a hint based on the scaffolding level, but
  NEVER reveal the final answer. Output a hidden JSON evaluation logging 'correct'
  or 'incorrect' for the system telemetry.
