category: retrieve
description: Run near-miss adversarial prompts that force distinction between confusable concepts under low support.
default_duration_min: 8
energy_cost: high
best_stage: exam_prep
control_stage: RETRIEVE
status: draft
tags:
  - retrieval
  - adversarial
  - confusables
mechanisms:
  - discrimination
  - retrieval
inputs:
  - Confusable pairs from Spine or ErrorLog
  - Question Bank Seed
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Select confusable pairs with highest error risk
    notes: Use recent Confusion errors first
  - step: 2
    action: Ask near-miss prompts with minimal cues
    notes: Require explicit discriminator in each response
  - step: 3
    action: Log misses to ErrorLog.csv
    notes: Include error_type and fix_applied
outputs:
  - Adversarial near-miss results
  - ErrorLog updates
stop_criteria:
  - Near-miss set completed
  - All misses logged
evidence:
  citation: Rohrer et al. (2015)
  finding: Interleaved discrimination practice improves transfer on confusable categories
  source: control-plane migration
evidence_raw: Rohrer et al. (2015); discrimination practice strengthens near-miss recognition

  You are running this method card in its assigned control stage. Execute only what this card defines.

  Operational instructions:
  1) Confirm required inputs from the card before starting. If inputs are missing, request only the minimum missing input.
  2) Follow the listed steps in order and keep output concise, structured, and actionable.
  3) Enforce control-stage boundaries:
     - PRIME: orientation and structure only; no scored checks or hidden calibration.
     - CALIBRATE: measure current state with confidence + performance signals.
     - ENCODE: force active processing; avoid passive lecture-only output.
     - REFERENCE: build concrete anchors/artifacts before any retrieval demand.
     - RETRIEVE: require learner attempt before revealing full answers.
     - OVERLEARN: run bounded fluency reps and stop at fatigue/cap criteria.
  4) Produce the outputs/artifacts listed on this card.
  5) Stop when stop_criteria are met and log required telemetry fields.
