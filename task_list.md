## Task List (Graph Toolbar Integration)

1. Locate `GraphPanel`, `ConceptMapEditor`, `ConceptMapStructured`, `ConceptMapFreehand`, `MindMapView`, `VaultGraphView`, and `MainContent` sources and exports.
2. Record each component's props, callbacks, and how any save/export/import hooks are wired today.
3. Enumerate shared toolbar hooks and note missing hooks required for a container-level toolbar.
4. Draft concise summary with file/line references and recommend the minimal integration path.
