[TASK CONTEXT]
You are surveying the PT Study SOP repo at C:\pt-study-sop to understand the dashboard/brain page composition, discover existing task/todo/planner components, and identify APIs and persistence patterns that could power a Kanban board.

[OBJECTIVES]
1. List dashboard-related files/components (especially brain.tsx, dashboard.tsx, and components/brain) that render or manage tasks/planners, including their purpose and how they are structured.
2. Identify the best insertion point for a Kanban board on the dashboard/brain page by describing current layout sections, containers, or cards and why they make sense for the board.
3. Document any API endpoints or backend routes (Flask or shared code) that provide task/planner data, and highlight persistence hooks (localStorage keys, Obsidian files, data caches) used by those components.

[CONSTRAINTS]
- Focus on files under dashboard_rebuild/client/src (pages and components) plus the brain Python Flask server and any docs referencing task persistence.
- Skip unrelated directories, tests, or assets.

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
Return a structured list with headings: 1) Dashboard components (path/purpose). 2) Kanban insertion candidates (location + reasoning). 3) APIs/persistence (endpoint or storage pattern + how components use it). Include file paths and any relevant localStorage/Obsidian references.

[SUCCESS]
Stop when at least three entries per section are documented with concrete paths, reasons, and persistence notes.
